November 28, 1966 Dr. Murray Senkus Re: Meeting on the Use of Vel-Bru as an Adjunct in Brewing, Falstaff Brewing Company in St. Louis, Missouri September 22, 1966 A meeting was held with Dr. Harold E. Weissler, Assistant Director Mr. Pilkington, Pilkington Chemical Brokerage Company Dr. Carl Kessler, Research Department, Penick & Ford, Ltd. Mr. Carl Moeller, Sales Rep., Penick & Ford, Ltd. Dr. William C. Squires, Research Department, RJR Dr. Weissler had attempted to extend wort by addition of Vel-Bru during the busy season. As a result, the fermentations were "sluggish", i.e., slow or incomplete. Mr. Moeller related the use of Vel-Bru by several brewers. Amounts between 30 and 35% of the total were successfully employed. One brewer was successfully diluting his wort by 50% with Vel-Bru. At this point, Dr. Weissler revealed that they had attempted to dilute wort with 70% of Vel-Bru. The problem then appeared to be clear. By such extensive dilution with carbohydrates, the other nutrients in wort such as organic nitrogen, vitamins and salts were probably at of R&D. In attendance were: suboptimal levels. Falstaff is not equipped to investigate the nutritional problems involved. Dr. Weissler asked that P&F provide information on what to add to permit 70% dilution with Vel-Bru or to provide modified Vel-Bru. It was suggested that RJR could and would investigate this problem, if wort and yeast were available. Dr. Weissler agreed to supply Falstaff wort and yeast cultures when we were ready. A time was not specified beyond stating that because of other investigations in progress, it might be as much as six months before we could initiate the study. billail Clanises William C.
