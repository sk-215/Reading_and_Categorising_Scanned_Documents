Research Department FILE NOTE November 26, 1979 MUSK COMFONENTS IN WISCONSIN CIGAR SMOKE - AMBRETTOLIDE AND ITS ISOMERS/415 Two major musk components were discovered in Wisconsin cigar leaf smoke (Peaks A and B in Figure 1). In an effort to identify these musk components as well as to search for a quality supply, commercial musk preparations from Givaudan and Alfred Bader Chemicals were analyzed by The mass spectrum (Figure 2) of musk Peak A in Wisconsin cigar smoke matched with those of the two Givaudan ambrettolide Peaks C and D in Figure 4 (mass spectra in Figures 5 and 6). According to Arctander's Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, No. 105, Givaudan ambrettolide contains mainly cyclohexadecem-7-olide (I) as shown in Figure 7. Judged from our analysis, the possibility of cis-trans isomers or double-bond shift isomers being present in Givaudan's sample could not be ruled out since nearly identical mass spectra were observed although these two The musk Peak B in Wisconsin cigar smoke (Figure 1), was considered as another isomer of ambrettolide (I), which gave a very similar mass spectrum with some minor differences in the relative intensities of some ABC's ambrettolide gave yet another possible isomer of ambrettolide Unequivocal identification of these closely related isomers can be carried out when pure authentic isomers are acquired for GC/mass spectral In conclusion, despite the fact that both these ambretolide preparations offered pleasing musk aromas, the Givaudan ambrettolide components seemed to match with the musk components in Wisconsin cigar smoke better gas chromstography/mass spectrometry. peaks were chromatographically different. ions.
