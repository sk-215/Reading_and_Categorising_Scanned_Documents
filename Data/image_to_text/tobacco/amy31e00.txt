Sorillard LORILLARD, INC. Research Center, 420 English Street, P.O. Box 21688, Greensboro, North Carolina 27420-1688 February 11, 1987 Dr. Peter T. Thomas Senior Toxicologist IIT Research Institute 10 West 35th Street Chicago, IL 60616 Dear Dr. Thomas: We have completed our review of four Immunomodulatory Screening Tests, recently submitted to Lorillard, and have the following comment. SN45LOR (A76) Page 9, Paragraph 1, last sentence: This statement is too vague as written. I would agree that an increase in spleen weight could indicate immune modulation; however, the relationship between toxicity and the observed immune response is unclear, as We have also reviewed SN42LOR(B199), SN43LOR (A166), and SN44LOR(A161). These reports are acceptable to us in their present form and can be considered final reports. Thank you for your attention to these reports. If you have any written. Please clarify this statement. questions, please feel free to call. Sincerely A Thomas A. Vollmuth, Ph.D. Toxicologist, Life Sciences /tb:1 A
