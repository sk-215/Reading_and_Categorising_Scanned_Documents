Glenn and McAllister: This is to thank you very much for the supplement to my current grant award in the sum of $35,000. The acceptance note plus a brief budget are enclosed. I would like to express once again my appreciation of the generous support for research which I have obtained from the CTR. The discovery of the WW domain, a new signaling module that is implicated in several diseases including: cancer, a genetic form of hypertension known as Liddle Syndrome, Muscular Dystrophy and Alzheimer's S Disease, was made possible because of your original support of a seed project that involved several risky approaches (for example the anti-idiotypic method to isolate proteins which communicate with an oncogene product). In addition, in sharp contrast to many other funding agencies, the CTR review panel consisted of top leaders and distinguished scientists. The news of dissolving The Council for Tobacco Research is sad indeed. On various forums and in different directions I voice my strong support for your public health service through cultivation of the innovative biomedical research. Istill have hope that the CTR will be revived. With kind regards, Yours sincerely,  Mar / - iw Marius Sudol, Ph.D. Associate Professor - CC. Dr. Arthur Eisenberg WE N ini Hyied
