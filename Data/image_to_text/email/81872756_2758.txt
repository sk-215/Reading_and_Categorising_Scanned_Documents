Please refer back to the original Falling Stars ad and ask the creative team to reproduce the numbers PRECISELY as they appear there. In this context you're shoving me here. the numbers look like they have been inserted haphazardly, as an afterthought, and do not appear as if they are a 'natural" part of the text, as in the original "Falling Stars" ad Please call ne if you do not understand vhat I'm describing.
