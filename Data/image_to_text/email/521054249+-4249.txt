Joyce and 1 talked and she feels we should slit at 641 as long as that factory is operational. Let's plan to handle this order at 641. Joyce will be in touch with you.

SMI has scheduled our tobacco sandwich paper delivery for the week of June 14. Will we still be able to slit the paper in building 641 after that or should we plan on only being able to use 604?

Doug; Davis, Sylvia A Doug Manuel, production superintendent responsible for the 604-10 operations, confirmed that we can handle the 27" wide material and that we have sufficient knife holders to slit that width to 15mm finished rolls. Either the 24" or We would like to slit the next batch of approx 5,000 Ibs at 641 prior to closing that facility. If we are able to do so we need a future timeline for requirements beyond this 5,000 so that we can prepare the slitting area at 604-10 to handle (isolate to avoid dust contamination in normal tipping operations, ventilation, humidity control, etc). 27" wide master rolls that mentioned can be slit.
