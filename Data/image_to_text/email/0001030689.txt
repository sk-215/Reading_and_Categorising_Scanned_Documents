Price, and Serban. Forward Header Subject: LEAF AGING Date: : Author: Elmer Litzinger at BWMRD1 0/3/95 :04 PM we are scheduled to conduct flue-cured leaf aging trials in Wilson or: October 5 and 7. These trials will be carried out to determine the effects of prizing, temp/RH, urea, and PG on chemical and sensory We will first need and urea analyses on bale core samples to select which bales from each run are OK for further analyses. Once this selection has been made, there will be a total of 40 bales The routine analyses we will need are: RAA-Sugars, tobacco pH, Non-routine analyses are HFP, organic acids (free and as their salts), aminc acids, DS Scan, and Purge & Trap. Ne are looking especially Eor oxidacive effects (organic acids and polyphenols) and sugar-a ammonia and sugar-amina acid reactions. IE you have any other readily implementable methods that you think might be he-pful please Let me know, Also, let me know of any deletions you think ought to be made to the analytical request list. John, wes Weeks said they no longer do protein analyses. Ken mentioned Ken Boyer of Southern Testing. We would like to follow changes. for routine and non-routine aralyses. polyphenois, and ammonia. protein during the course of aging. Thanks, Elmer 405000046
