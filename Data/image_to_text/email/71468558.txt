The authors collected information from 468 patients and 574 healthy controls. The 1. The risk of papillary thyroid cancer was about a half in current smokers compared to that in never smokers (OR=0.5, 95% CI=0.4-0.7). This result is statistically significant. 2. No reduction in risk was present among women who quit smoking in the more distant past. 3. The risk of papillary thyroid cancer reduced about 30% in current alcohol drinkers compared to that in 4. Among women drinkers aged more than 45 years, the risk reduced about 60%, compared to that in 5. If the current smokers are current drinkers, than the relative risk would be further reduced. (OR=0.4, 6. The possible mechanisms, according to the authors, is that "cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption reduce thyroid cell proliferation through effects on thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), estorgen or other mechanisms" 'available data suggest that TSH are lower in smokers than nonsmokers. Decreased TSH levels in newborn babies of smoking compared with nonsmoking 1. The results were obtained by using logistic regression and the tollowing potential confounders were controlled: Age, county of residence; race; marital status; educational attainment; history of radiation treatment to the head or neck as a child or adolescent; family history of thyroid cancer; menstrual, pregnancy and actation history; use of oral contraceptive, measures of body size; history of benign thyroid disease. Therefore, the results are relatively reliable compared to studies without adjusting the 2. The results are consistent with that reported in previous studies. Both former and current female smokers were noted to be at a reduced risk of thyroid cancer in a Swedish study" (OR=0.5, 95%CI=0. 2-0.96, and 0.6. CI=0. .3-0.96). Galanti reported that premenopausal women cigarette smokers had a statistical significant decreased risk (OR=0.60; CI=0.38-0.96). 3. However, diet, as a potential confounder, was not adjusted in this study. Diet was reported to be associated with risk of thyroid cancer in one study". We can't exclude the possibility that the reported 4.
