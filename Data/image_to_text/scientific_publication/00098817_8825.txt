MELVILLE" Medizinische Abtcilung des Silikose- Forschungsinstituts der BesbaeBeruhgnowemshan (Chefarzt: Prof. W.T. ULMER), Bochum Abstract. Rats and hamsters were exposed to the Key Words smoke of unfiltered cigarettes for prolonged periods. The Tobacco smoke resuits indicated that the smoke-exposed animals were Mucociliary activity smaller than their corresponding control mates. In addi- Ciliary activity tion, the exposed animals demonstrated a larger variety -Cilia of mucociliary abnormalities including zones of ciliary Respiratory tract inactivity, disturbance of the coordination of ciliary movement, impaired mucus production and altered rheological characteristics of mucus. The possible relationship to chronic bronchitis is discussed. The link between cigarette smoking and cancer of the tracheobron- chial tree has often been suggested by epidemiological studies [HOLLAND, 1968; MOORE, 1971; SADOWSKI, 1953), however, in man no significant changes or permanent impairment of mucociliary clearance w√©re found in habitual tobacco smokers and in subjccts who have been smoking over a long period of time (PAVIA et al., 1970; PAVIA and THOMSON, 1970). On the other hand, mucociliary clearance in animals was shown to be affect- ed by cigarette smokc (DAHLHAM and RYLANDER, 1963; KAMINSKI et al., 1968; KENSLER and BATTISTA, 1963). IRAVANI [1972] found bronchitic patches and ciliary abnormalities in rats exposed to the smoke of unfil- 1 Financial support to carry out this study was granted by the "Verein zur Un- tersuchung von Einwirkungen der Luftverschmutzung auf die Volksgesundheit'. 1 This work was performed with the technical assistance of M.
