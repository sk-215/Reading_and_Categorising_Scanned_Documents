HDL cholesterol was determined in 251 females and 194 mal√®s. and total serum cholesterol in 677 females and 657 males, all aged 0-49 years. With respect to HDL cholesterol, significant sex differences were observed both in absolute level and in age-related change. A negative correlation between HDL cholesterol and total serum cholesterol was observed in all age groups except remales aged 0-19 years, supporting. the hypothesis of HDL as a 'clearing' lipoprotein. HDL cholesterol showed a positive correlation only in pairs of first-degree relatives involving the mother andi in sib sib pairs of the same sex. On the other hand, for serum cholesterol a positive correlation was found among all family members, although sig- nificantly higher between first-degree relatives than between spouses. No relation was found between cigarette smoking, physical activity or familial occurrence of MI and the HDL cholesterol or total serum choles- terol concentrations. In accordance with the 'HDL hypothesis', the present finding could partly explain the higher incidence A ischemic heart disease (IHD) in males than in females, and partly also the high risk which is tmmuited from women with IHD to their first-degree Norway F relatives..
