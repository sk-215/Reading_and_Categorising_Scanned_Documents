This increased popularity of mentholated cigarettes has been: accompanied by increased efforts determine the fate of menthol while the cigarette is in stor age and while it is being to smoked. Jenkins et al.' have presented data on the distillation, combustion, and pyrolysis contribution: of C'4-labeled menthol to the mainstream cigarette smoke. Brozinskil et al.? data which described menthol migration ini a cigarette: and the effect of have presented cigarette age and of the initial placement of menthol on its delivery. This work describes the effect of filter weight, filten surface area, plasticizer type, plasticizer and storage time: on menthol migration from the tobacco column to the concentration, acetate filter of a filter cigarette. EXPERIMENTAL Equipment Gas Chromatographic Unit Varian Aerograph phase. Model 600-D chromatograph was used toanalyze the smoke samples. gas This instrument was equipped with a single 3-ft X 1/8-in. stainiess steel.column. packediwith. Chromosorb-G (80-100 mesh) chroinatography packing coated with Casterwax (3%) liquid: The temperatures of the injector, column, and detector wer e maintained at 195, 125, The carrier gas (helium), hydrogen, and air were maintained at and 125Â°C, respectively. flow rates of 60, 22, and 350 ml/min, respectively.
