MEASUREMENT of TOBACCO-SMOKING The authors present the problems involved in determining the efject of tobacco smoking in clini- cal investigations and epidemiological surveys. - Any valid account of a tobaccogenic, tobacco-induced, or tobacco-aggravated disease must be solidly based upon two principles, first, the proper diagnosis of that disease, and second, an accurate measurment of the smoking habits of the patient. Of these two data, the former-as difficult as diagnosis may sometimes be-is the more easily ascertainable. Almost invariably, in clinical and epidemiological studies, the smoking habits of the patients are described in terms of daily tobacco (or cigarette) consumption; and tobacco consumption, as we shall see, bears a very indeterminate and perhaps even undeterminable relationship to the effective dosage of tobacco-smoke to which the patient is subjected. In the same way, the arsenic consumption of the "arsenic eaters" of Styria is not a measure of the effective dosage of arsenic these peasants receive, since, of the gross amount ingested. only a (sublethal) portion is actually absorbed. On the other hand, however, the alcohol consumption of drinkers is a direct measure of the effective dosage of this agent, since virtually all of ingested alcohol is absorbed. Thus, if we ask a patient how much whiskey he drinks per day, his reply-if truthful- -is also pharmacologically and hence clinically meaningful; but if we ask a patient how many cigarettes he smokes daily, his answer-even if he can actually remember (see Lancet 2: 1226, 1957)- is meaningless on both P.
