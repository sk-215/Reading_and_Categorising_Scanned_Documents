INTRODUCTION Air-cured tobaccos arc characteristically low in reducing sugars. Certain burlcy tobaccos, uscd in American-blend cigarettes, yicld strong, pungent smokes whose cflects arc not entirely attributable to alkaloids. Addition of sugars and other casings improves the overall smoking qualitics of these air-cured tobaccos'-s, but few studies of the ond-products from the sugars have-been made. Thc fate, on burning, of sugars added to the burley portion of a cigarette blend of tobaccos has therefore Bradford et al.' and Dittmar* indicated a lessening of the volatile bases in smoke, and Sugawara ct al. s reported increases in reducing substances in the smoke of cased tobaccos. Others have shown an improvement in the smoking qualities of strong tobaccos by the usc ofsugars, of organic acids, and of sugars plus glycero! and Fagerson and Stedman'o have reviewed thermal degradations of sugars as related to food and tobacco chemistry. Many products, primarily carbonyi and furan compounds, have bcen identified by modern instrumental techniques, and mechanisms In experiments on cigarette smoke, Quin et al."7 reported that sugars are not significant precursors of the furoic and levulinic acids in smoke. They found that the addition of sugars to all-burley cigarettes did not increase the proportion of volatile acids in the smoke. Larson and Harlow18 added D-glucose-1*Cto all-burley cigarettes, and calculated that 7 to 10% of the volatile acids was formed from the D-glucose casing; this range is comparable to the proportion, by weight, of casing been studicd. propylene glycol casingss-s. of formation have been proposed'1-10.
