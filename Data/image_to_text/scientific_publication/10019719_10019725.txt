Dooley and Millian A. Pryor* Departaent of Cheniatry, Louisians State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70603 Received February 5, 1982 SUMHARY: Exposure of hunan a-1-proteinase inhibitor to 15 ppe nitrogen dioxide and 1 :H hydrogen peroxide results in a 651 loss in the anti-elastase activity of the protein after one hour. Exposure to either nitrogen dioxide or hydrogen peroxide alone has no effect. The inhibition is partially prevented when mannitol or superoxide disnutase ie included during the exposure, iaplying that superonide and the hydroxyl radical are formed in reactions betveen nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen peroxide and play a role in Ststiatics indicate that persons vho moke cigarettes face a greater risk of developing pulnonary emphysesa than do nonsaokers (1). Pulmonary emphysens, vhich involves the breakdow of alveolar etructures by elastolytic protesses froe lung leukocytes, is thought to occur when an inbalance exists betveen the protesses and protease inhibitors in the epithelial fluid (2). me principal antiprotense, accounting for approxisately 902 of the elastase inhibitory capacity (EIC) of hunan serus, te e-1-proteinase inhibitor (2). An inherited dericiency of this antiprotease predisposes an individual to development ot pulmonery eaphysena at an early age (3): hovever, aost persons suffering troa enphysena have noraal e-1-proteinase inhibitor levels in their serus. In these cases, the developsent of the disease ia suspected to be - result of local Inactivation of the antiprotease by environmental toxins, particularly the oxidizing cooponente of eigarette snoke (4,5). *Address reprint requests and correspondence to this author Abbreviations: EIC, elastase inhibitory capacity; S(ALA)MA, ERMNCANACNICAtiavitimugsitet the inhibitory proceas. 0W-2LXR/10.-0130.010 Copvnghl o 19R2 by Acedemic Press.
