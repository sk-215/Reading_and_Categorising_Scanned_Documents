ABSTRACT Because kinins affect vascular tone, it is assumed that kinins act directly on snooth muscle. However, a direct interaction is difficult to conceive. Vessels containing smooth mascle are lined by a continuous endothelium with tight junctions. In addition, kinins act on endothelial cells to cause the release of prosta- glandin-related substances; possibly through receptors. Further- nore, endothelial cells have a great capacity for hydrolyzing kinins to inactive products. Hence, even invoking active transport, less than 12 of kinins might be expected to reach the first layer of saooth muscle cells. However, kinins may not act directly on smooth muscle as endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells form specialized cell contacts. Myoendothelial junctions occur, and we have shown, in pulmonary arterioles, that snooth muscle cells send large numbers of projections into the cytoplasm of the endothelial cells. In addition, smooth muscle cells attach directly to the abluminal surface of endothelial cells, as do pericytes. Thus there is a morphologic basis by which kinins can affect tone of enooth mustle without acting directly on smooth muscle cells. INTRODUCTION Although kinins and angiotensins are classified as hornones that affect smooth sauscle, it is by no means clear how these hor- mones interact with smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, there are cireunstances in which it is difficult to conceive of neans by which, e.g., bradykinin can reach smooth muscle cells in order to exert an affect. Thus, bradykinin infused intravenously can dilate 375
