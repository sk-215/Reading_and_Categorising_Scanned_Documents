However, patcbes were ubserved in the tracheo- bronchial epithelium of these animals in which mucocillarymechanism was abnormal. Also numerous areas of ciliary inactivity were present. These alterations in muco- ciliary function were very similar to those found in bronchitis: Introduction According to extensive epidemiological studies, there is a high incid- ence of chronic bronchitis in smokers (1]. It is believed that the bron- chitis may be related to the ciliary depressant action of the cigarette smoke. However, investigations in man have demonstrated that even in heavy smokers the clearance of inhaled particles from the tracheobron- chial tree is not significantly reduced [2, 3]. Thus, the precise mecha- nism underlying the genesis of bronchitis in smokers is still unexplained. A reappraisal of the effects of long-term exposure to cigarette smoke has 1 This work was supported by Verein zur Untersuchung der Einwirkung von been attempted in the following experiments.
