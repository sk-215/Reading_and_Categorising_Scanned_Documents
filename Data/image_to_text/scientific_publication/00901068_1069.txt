The Food Chemicals Codex (1972) has a monograph on a-phellandrene. CAS Registry No. 99-83-2. Acute toxicitys The acute oral LD,o in rats was reported as 57 g/kg (47-67 g/kg) and the Irritation. z-Phellandrene applied fuli strength to intact or abraded rabbit skin for 24hr under occlusion was moderately irritating (Moreno, 1972). Tested at 4 and 8%, in petrolatum, it. producedi no irritation aller a 48-hr closed-patch test on two separate panels of human subjects (Kligman, 1972), 2-Phellandrene can be irritating to, and absorbed through. the skin (Merck Index, 1976). Human toxicit). Ingestion of a-phellandrene can cause vomiting and diarrhoca (Merck Index, Sensititation. A maximization test (Kligman, 1966; Kligman & Epsiein, 1975) was carried out on 25. volunteers. The material (RIFM no. 71-68) was tested at a concentration of 49. in petrolatum and produced onc sensitization reaction (Kligman, 1972). In view of tle autoxidation problems reported by. Pirila & Siltanen (1955 & 1958) and Pirila, Siltanen & Pirila (1964), it was decided that the maximization procedure should be repeated on x-phellandrene using a freshly distilled sample processed under a blanket of nitrogen and containing butylated hydroxyanisole as: an anti- oxidant. The same maxumization lest was carcied oul on another 25 volunteers using this freshly pro- cessed sample (RIFM no. 72-76). The material was tested at a concentration of 8% in petrolatum and produced no sensitization reactions (Kligman, 19721. Phellandrene was identified as a sensitizer in a study of the sensitizing potential of some essential oils and thein constituents (Wocber & Metabolism. In sheep. x-phellandrene apparently. undergoes reduction of one double bond and oxidation of the methyl group 10 give phellandral. which is further oxidized to phellandric acid: conjugation with glycine gives rise to phellanduric acid, which is then excreted in the urine (Williams, 1959). It has abo been suggested that 7 phellandrenc is 23.5-trilydroxylated to p-menthotriol and Percutaneous ahsorption. Phellandrene was readily absorbed through the skin of rats (Valette & Curcinoyenicity. Phellandrene has been reported to promote tumour formation on the skin of mice trealed with the primary carcinogen 2dmsahibemt-lamthisemr (Roc & Ficld. 1965). Insecis. 1 Phellandrene attracted male fruit flies (Ceraritis cupitata). (Guiotto. Fornasiero & Bacci- Biological data acute dermal LD,o in rabbits exceeded 5 gkg (Moreno. 1972). 1976), M Krombach, 1969). excreted as a glucuronide (Williams. 1959). Cavier, 1954). chetti, 1972).
