V. Rana Gastry, Victoria E. Janson, L1111an K. Owens and Osama S. Tayeb Departnent of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, U.S.A. (Received 28 June 1982: accepted 6 August 1982) Acetylcholine (ACH) occurs in marmalian spermat tozoa (1-2). Selective inhibitors of choline acetyltransferase (ChA) depress the motility index of human spernatozos, and there is a positive relationship between the depression of the spenm mot11ity index and inhibition of ChA (4). According to our studies, nethionine enkephalin and Substance P regulate ACh release by in- hibiting or enhancing ca2* uptake by the neuronal tissues (5-7). Similarly, methionine enkephalin and Substance P may play a regulatory role in ACh- induced C42* movements and, therefore, progressive spern notility. He have extracted enkephalins and related optoid peptides and Substance P from human, bull, and rat spermatozoa; human seninal plasna; and accessory sex glands of the rat. Our investigations indicate that there are high levels of these peptides in human seminal plasma, possibly from secretions of the epididymis Standard methionine enkephalin and leucine enkephalin were purchased from the Pierce Chenical Co., Rockford, IL. Rabbit anti-net enkephalin, anti-leu-enkephalin, anti-8-endorphin, ant1-Substance P, (125ilrethionine enkephalin, (1251Jleucine enkephalin, (1251)-s-endorphin, and (1251JSubstance P were supplied by the Imuno Nuclear Corp.. Stillwater, MN. Each antibody has 100% cross reactivity with its corresponding antigen-peptide and negli- gible cross reactivity with other peptides. For exanple, the antibody of methionine enkephalin has cross reectivity of 100% with standard mothionine enkephalin; 1.6X with leucine enkephalin; and 0.002x with Subs tance P and Extraction of peptides from spermatozoa and seminal plasna. The collec- tion of human ejaculates, separation and washing of spermatozoa, source of bull spernatozoa, and collection of rat epididymal spermatozon have been described in our previous publications (1,4). Seminal vesicles and prostate glands were dissected fron rats. A11 of the above tissues were extracted for peptides by procedures published from our laboratories (8,9). The final preparations were waxy res idues which were stored at -20Â°. Radioiamunoassays for rethionine enkephalin, leucine enkephalin,- endorphin, and SubstanceP. Each waxy extract was resuspended in distilled and accessory sex glands. MATERIALS AND METHODS 6-endorphin.
