HDL apoprotein A-I is an important cofactor in this reaction (Fielding and Fielding. 1971: Soutar el al.. 1975). Although the metaholic significance of the LCAT reaction has not been completely elucidated. Glomset (1979) has postulated that LCAT may be involved in the removal of excess phos- pholipid and free cholesterol from lipoprotein remnants and may participate in the mobilization of cholesterol from peripheral cell membranes and its subsequent HDL serves as the lipoprotein substrate for LCAT and may also have antiatherogenic properties related to its ability 10 remove cholesterol from extru- hepatic tissue (Glomset and Norum. 1973: Glomset. 1979). Numerous epidemio- logical studies have demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between HDL cholesterol concentration and the incidence of coronary heart disease (Gordon et al.. 1977: Castelli et al.. 1977). A similar correlation also exists between coronary heart disease and HDL's major protein component. apoprotein A-1 (Berg ei al.. 1976). Much recent attention has focused on HDL levels and established heart disease risk factors such as cigarette smoking (Enger er al.. 1977: Hulley et al.. 1979; Berg et al.. 1979: Garrison et ul.. 1978). Results from these studies show that smoking reduces HDL cholesterol (Enger et al.. 1977: Hulley et al., 1979: Garri- son et ul.. 1978) and apoprotein A-1 and A-I1 levels (Berg et al.. 1979).
