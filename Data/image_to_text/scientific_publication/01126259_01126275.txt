IN VIVO AND IN VITRO STUDIES ON THE QUESTION OF A BIOLOGIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NICOTINE AND ASCORBIC ACID () () () BY R. I. TABER (9) AND P. S. LARSON (Received for publicution 26-10-1963). The physiological and biochemical effects of tobacco smoke and nicotine have been extensively investigated but, thus far, few attempts have been made to ascertain their effect on the nutritive state of the body. One area in this field that has yielded provocative but not altogether con- sistent results concerns the effect of these agents on ascorbic acid Diminished ascorbic acid content in the blood (31, 7), plasma (13), plasma and leucocytes (10), urine (27, 28, 13), and maternal milk (30) of smokers has been reported. Decreased ascorbic acid levels in the blood, urine and tissues proportional to the amount of tobacco smoke exposure has been claimed in experimental animals (31). In contrast 'to these reports, no differences in ascorbic acid blood levels were found in more than 100 smokers and nonsmokers, even when they smoked three If tobacco smoke has an effect on ascorbic acid metaholism, nicotine might be considered to be at least a factor in this.
