(Reccived 16 June 1970) Eastern Utilization Research and Development Division, Agricultural Rescarch Service, United States Department of Agriculture, 600 East Mermaid Lane, Philadelphia, Abstract- -A lumorigenic neulral subfraction of cigarette smoke condensate cluting from silicie acid with benzene and soluble in dimethylsulfoxide was shown to contain tbe following cunstiluents: 2-bulylphenol; 2-isohutylphenol; 2ethyl-d-methy/phenol; 3-ethylbenzonitrile; 23-dinethylhemzonitrile: 2-ethylbenzo- nitrile; 26-dmecthylbenazonitrile; 4-ethylbeazonitrile and 2.)-dinethylbeazonitrie. Evidenoc was also obtained for the presence of 2- methylbenzonitrile and Zethy.s.edinethyipocal, None of these com- ponents has bcen reported previously in condensate. The partition coefficients in etber,iN NaOH ranged from 1-1 to 44 for the four phenols, indicating that their occurrence in the neutral: fraction would be expected. The: amounts of constituents thaty were isolated and identified: ranged from 0-6 to: 2:21 mg/kg smoke condensate. THE NEUTRAL fraction of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) is a major contributor to the tumorigenic activity of CSC in animals.' On fractionation of the neutral substances by solvent partitioning, 2 tumorigenic activity is observed in all subfractions, and the nitro- methane-soluble subfraction is the most active. Compositional studies on the latter have shown the presence of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons,*.5 quinones, 6 myristicin," secondary arylamines, benzyl esters" and cinnamonitri ile." In more. recent work, the neutral substances of CSC have been separated by silicic acid chromatography and solvent parti- tioning,' 10,11 and tumorigenic activity has been found in several subfractions." 12 The present report concer ns the isolation and identification of several components in one ofthese active E.
