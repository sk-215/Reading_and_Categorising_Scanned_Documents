Further Studies on the Circulation Index with an Evaluation of the 1A V  a Mee Diagnostic and Therapeutic Value of Priscoline? :r a 49 MORRIS T. FRIEDELL, M.D. WALTER INDECK, M.D. AND FENTON SCHAFFNER, M.D. CHICAGO THE CONDITION of the peripheral vascular circulation can be estimated by means of radioactive isotopes. A method in which radioactive phosphorus is used to test the status of the peripheral cir- culation has been described." Data so obtained not only afford a sur- vey of circulatory efficiency but can be helpful as a guide to prognosis and treatment. The method is applicable to the investigation of new drugs designed to treat peripheral vascular disease. This report is concerned with some observations on the use of 2-benzylimidazoline hydrochloride (priscoline*), whose effect occurs chiefly at the ter- mination of the sympathetic nerves in the vascular smooth muscle. It may also have a direct histamine-like effect on the smaller vessels." According to Wirsa and Ottoman, the action of the drug is complex, causing peripheral vasodilatation and increased cardiac output. CIRCULATORY INDEX AS DETERMINED BY RADIOISOTOPES Two hundred mierocuries of radioactive phosphorus (Pst) as a phosphate ion is injected intravenously, and a thin-walled beta counter is applied to the sole.
