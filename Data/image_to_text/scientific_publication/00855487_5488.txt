Peru balsam was granted GRAS status by FEMA (1965) and is approved by the FDA for food use (GRAS). The Council of Europe (1970) included Peru balsam in the list of substances, spices and seasonings deemed admissible. for use, with a possible limitation of Acute toxicity. The acute oral LDso value in rats was reported as >5g/kg (Lynch, 1971a). The acute dermal LDso value in rabbits was reported as > 10 g/kg (Lynch, 1971b). Irritation. Peru balsam applied full strength to intact or abraded rabbit skin for 24hr under occlusion was moderately irritating (Lynch, 1971b). Tested at 8% in petrolatum, it produced no irritation after a 48-hr closed-patch test on human subjects (Kligman, 1971). Again tested at 8% it produced no irritation alter a 24-hr closed-patch test in 50 human Sensitication. A maximization test (Kiigman, 1966) was carried out on 25 volunteers. The material. was tested at a concentration of 8% in petrolatum and produced sensitization reactions in seven of those tested (Kligman, 1971). Peru balsam (8%) was also: tested by the repeated insult patch test procedure (Shelanski & Shelanski, 1953), using 15 24-hr exposures in 50 human subjects, without producing sensitization reactions (Shelanski, Hjorth(1961), in a monumentaltreatise: on eczematous: reactions to balsams with special reference to balsam ofl Peru, reported the incidence olipositive reactions to patch tests with Peru balsam. Analysis of patch tests at six Scandinavian clinics (represented on the Scan- dinaviun committce for standardization of routinc. patch testing) showed- thati the inci- dences of reactions to the substances differed from one clinic to another and according to sex. and that of 5558 patients tested. 697-producedareaction to Peru balsam (Magnus- son, Blohm, Fregert, Hjorth, Hevding, Pirila & Skog, 1968). In a further series of 4000 patients patch-tested in five European clinics, 1000 were engaged. in domestic work only, including 281 women with contact dermatitis of the hands. Half of the 281 women gave a positive patch test, the commonest allergen being balsam (27%) (Calnan, Bandmann, Cronin, Fregert, Hjorth, Magnusson, Malten. Meneghini, Pirila & Wilkinson, 1970). A collaborative study of contact dermatitis in five departments of dermatology has yielded a detailed analysis of the first 4000 patients. A diagnosis of dermatitis of occupa- tional origin was reached in 28% of 1618 men and 13% of the 2382 women. Peru balsam was equally involved in both occupational and non-occupational groups and may be con- sidered a consumer hazard as well as an occupational one (Malten, Fregert, Bandmann, Calnan.
