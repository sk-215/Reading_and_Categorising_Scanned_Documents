Wal /Rer fud. / As PERINI FLORIAN 63..: C19781 DETECTION AND DETERMINATION OF VOLATILE AND NON-VOLATILE ANITROSAMINES BY THIN-LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY USING FLUORESCAMINE J.C.ZOUNG Agriculture Ottawa, Ontario Chemist try and Biology Research Institute, Canada, - KBF Detection of N-nitrosamines on thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) silica gel plates has been accomplished by cleavage with ultraviolet (UV) light or HBr to afford the correspording secondary amine and nitrous acid or its equivarenl. The amine is then detected with ninhydrin (Kr8ller, 1967; Sen et al., 1969) and nitrous acid with Preussmann reagent (Pacl,-diphenylamine) (Preussmann et al., 1964a,b), Griess reagent (1-naphthylamine sulfanilic acid) (Preussmann et al., 1965b), or NEDSA reagent (-1-naphthylene-diamine-mulfanilic acid) (Sen & Dalpe, 1972) to give coloured spots. About 1 ug of N-nitrosamine can be detected by these methods. Sen et al. (1973) report detecting 50 ng of N-mitrosopyrrolidine as a fluorescent spot after UV irradiation and treatment with ninhydrin. Alternatively, reduction of N-nitrosamines with lithium aluminum hydride affords the corresponding hydrazines, which can be detected by treatment with appropriate aldehydes to give coloured (Neurath et al., 1964; Serfontein & Smit, 1967) or fluorescent Photolysis of N-nitrosamines on TLC plates (Kr√¥ller, 1967; Sen et al., 1969) or in acidic solution (Chow, 1973; Fridman et al., 1971) has been reported to afford secondary amines or related products. On activated TLC plates (silica gel or aluminum oxide), the majority of N-nitrosamines examined by us thus far afford primary amines upon UV irradiation and these amines can subsequently be detected as fluorescent spots at the 50-200 pmole level, after treatment with the primary amine- specific reagent fluorescamine (Young, 1976a, Young, 1977b; Young et spots (Yang & Brown, 1972). al., 1977).
