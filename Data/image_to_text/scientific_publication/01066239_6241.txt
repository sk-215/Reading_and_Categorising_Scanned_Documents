OHSHIMA & T. KAWABATA Department of Biomedical Research on Food, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan : INTRODUCTION : - Several investigators have recently pointed out that a compound having a tertiary amine or quarternary ammonium moiety in its structure, as well as various secondary amines, may react with nitrite under acidic conditions to give the carcinogenic nitroso compound and that this process would be a possible source of environmental carcino- gens for humans. Among these compounds, trimethylaminoxide (TMAO) is known to occur widely in sea-water fish and shellfish in fairly high concentrations. In addition, trimethylamine (TMA) in sea foods may be mainly produced from TMAO by the action of various putrefactive It has already been reported- that the nitrosation of both TMA and TMAO may. give carcinogenic N-nitrosodinethylamine (NDMA) (Ender et al., 1967; Fiddler et al., 1972; Lijinsky & Singer, 1974; Lijinsky et al., 1972a; Malines et al., 1970; Scanlan et al., 1972). Most of these authors, however, aimed to clarify the possibility of NDMA formation from THA or TMAO at elevated temperatures and near neutral conditions, while few studies have reported the possibility of the in vivo formation of NDMA, especially under the conditions obtaining in the human stomach. We usually ingest a variety of tertiary amine kinetics or mechanism of the nitrosation of these compounds, compared with secondary amines. The present study concerns the kinetics of nitrosation of IMA and TMAO to give NDMA in vitro. bacteria. ammonium in the forms of drugs, food additives or quarternary or natural compounds food components.
