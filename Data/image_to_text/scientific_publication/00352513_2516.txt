National Food Institute, 19 Markhaj Bygade, DK 2860 Saborg (Denmark) (Received June 29th, 1983) (Accepted July 9th, 1983) SUMMARY Pulegone and menthol, components of peppermint oil, were investigated in rats. The substances were administered by gavage for 28 days at 0, 20, 80, 160 mg pulegone and 0, 200, 400, 800 mg menthol/ kg body wt./day, respectively. At the two highest doses, pulegone induced atonia, decreased blood creatinine content, lowered terminal body weight and caused histopathological changes in the liver and in the white maiter of cerebellum. For menthol at all dose levels a significant increase in absolute and relative liver weights and vacuolisation of hepatocytes was found. No: sign of encephalopathy was observ- The no effect level for pulegone was 20 mg/kg body wt./day and for menthol <200 mg/kg body ed in rats given menthol. wt./day. INTRODUCTION Neuropathy has been induced in rats given peppermint oil [1). Peppermint oil consists of several compounds [2). The substances responsible for the toxic effect have not yet been identified. 2: short-term studies were conducted with pulegone and menthol, which constitute 1-3% and 35-50% of peppermint oil, respectively. At one time pulegone was used as an ineffective abortifacient and may provoke convulsions in man [3, 4). A few years ago intoxication and deaths in women were reported (5, 6). In 1972 it was recommended that its use as a food flavour be pro- hibited (3] and the Committee of Experts on Flavourings of the Council of Europe The results of one study on menthol in man suggested that adverse effects may occur at ingestion of about 2 mg/kg body wt./day, while other evidence from 7 a proposed that its presence in lood be limited (7). 00352513 0378-4274/83/S 03.00 @ Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.
