BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORPORATION RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT & ENGINEERING FILE NOTE TITLE: COMPARISONS OF VICEROY, MARLBORO, AND WINSTON KS SMOKED THROUGH CHARCOAL FILTERS/399 AUTHOR: Mr. R. H. Honeycutt DATE: CC: October 11, 1985 Mr. E. E. Kohnhorst, Mr. M. L. Reynolds, Mr. T. F. Riehl, Dr. W. H. Deines, Dr. J. G. Esterle, Dr. J. H. Lauterbach, Mr. C. J. Rosene, Dr. F. K. St.Charles, Mr. J. F. X. Daum Six Product Department smokers compared the subjective properties of VICEROY, Marlboro, and Winston KS smoked through filters containing 400 mg of activated charcoal. This much charcoal should* remove more than 70% of the organic vapor phase smoke components, but give very low removal of particulates. Based on blind, monadic comparisons: There were no significant differences between products for Smoke impact was enhanced and irritation (tongue, mouth, and Tobacco taste was reduced or masked by the prominent charcoal any of the attributes. throat) was very low. off-taste. Previous work showed that the only contribution of the smoke vapor phase was irritation and foul taste. The VICEROY KS vapor phase was more irritating than that of Marlboro or Winston KS. Removal of these irritation/off-taste clues by the charcoal removes discrimination among the three brands. The charcoal probably stripped enough of the "semi-volatile" flavor compounds from the particulate phase to significantly reduce tobacco taste, leaving impact as the predominant smoke sensation. These results support (but do not prove) the notion that some of the compounds producing tobacco taste might also produce irritation. However, for proper interpretation of the subjective findings, it is important that good smoke analytical data be available. *Analytical smoke results (smoke aldehydes, 0/WP) not yet received.
