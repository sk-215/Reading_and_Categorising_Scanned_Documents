No. He's relaxxxxxing and enjoying hinself! Nice ittle boat ride. Looks like fun. Where? No where around here -probably Wisconsin...I don 't know that much about lakes.. (LAUGHS) ..boats either...I wouldr.'t want ta do that (LIFESTYLE) all the time but I wouldr't mind doing it for about 2 or 3 weeks, : .He looks fairly well to do. He got a cigarette, though. That's going to help him relax with that cigarette. T smoke because I LIKE it - not a habit so much as I enjoy smoking. INT. : How can you tell he's relaxed? Tho position he's in. (LAUGHS) Laying down with feet up...If that's a she she's got awful hairy arms, I'11 say that. (LAUGHS) Short fingernails, hairy arms, or dark hair...probably fairly good looking - 35-40... I picture him with wavy hair...If that boat belongs to him he must be a politician (LAUGHS) - a the way he 's relaxing, he knows what he's doing.. politicans are the or.ly people with enough money to buy something like that....I'd like to be out there enjoying myself. I don' t particularly care if I owned a boat or not...maybe he's just a passenger... He's got to be with people - that wuldn't be any fun being gotta be a he. Probably dark-complected probably brown
