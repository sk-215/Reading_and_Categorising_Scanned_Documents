HUGH FUDENBERG, M.D. ROGER K. LARSON, M.D. In order to evaluate possible genetic contributions to chronic obstruc- tive pulmonary disease (COPD), a systematic study was undertaken of of first-degree relatives (siblings andi offspring) of allsevere COPD patients referred to the Valley Medical Center in Fresno. For purposes. of com- parison, their marital partners ("environmental controls") were studied in the same manner. The studies consisted of a routine history questionnaire, a physical examination of the heart and lungs, a standard 14 X 17 inch chest x-ray, spirometry including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second and in 3 seconds (FEVIO, FEVI0), and maximum midexpiratory flow rate (MMIF), residual volume (RV) determi- nation by the closed-cireuit helium dilution technique, calculation of total lung capacity (TLC), and RV/TLC, and determination of serum trypsin inhibitory capacity. Relatives and controls (marital partners): were then classified as normal, mild to moderately abnormal, or severely abnormal This work was supported by grants from the Council for Tobacco Research and on the basis of the pulmonary function studies.
