TSO Tobacco Laboratory, Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, Md., USA INTRODUCTION Nitrosamines may be causative factors in cancers of various sites which are correlated with tobacco use. These diseases include cancer of the lung, oral cavity, oesophagus, pancreas and bladder (Day, 1975; Jayant et al., 1977; U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1964, 1971, 1975; Wynder & Bross, 1961; Wynder & Goldsmith, 1977; Wynder et al., 1957, 1963,- 1973). Smokers:run an increased risk of all these types of cancer and tobacco chewers have a higher incidence of cancer of the oral cavity and oesophagus. Tobacco and tobacco mainstream and sidestream smoke, as well as other environmental sources, contain varying amounts of volatile nitrosamines, such as nitrocodimethylamine and nitrosopyrrolidine, as reported elsewhere in this volume Of special interest, however, are the tobacco-specific nitrosamines which are derived from the tobacco alkaloids. The procotype of these compounds is W'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN). In previous reports in IARC Scientific Publications, we have presented data on the presence of NNN in tobacco and. tobacco smoke and on the formation and carcinogenicity of this compound (Iloffman et al., 1974, -395- TARC #19 1978 395-413 PP -
