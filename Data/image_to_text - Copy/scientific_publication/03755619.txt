(Received 18 December 1980, accepted 20 February 1981) We describe - simple procedure for isolation of Vicia villos lectin with binding speci- ficity for Nacetyloglactoumine > D-galactowe. Also, a rosette asay using V. villosa lectin coupled-SRBC is described which enables us to both visualize lectin binding cells and to fractionate lymphocytes from in vitro primary mixed lymphoeyte cultures on the basis of ability to bind V. villosa lectin. INTRODUCTION It has been reported that lymphocytes with cytolytic activity can be spe- cifically fractionated on affinity columns bearing lectin derived from Vicia villosa seeds (Kimura' et al., 1979). The binding of various lectins to lympho. cytes has been detected by immunofluorescence using fluorescein isothio- cyanate-labeled lectin, or by radioimmunoassay using "I-labeled lectin (Kimura et al., 1979; Fowlkes et al., 1980). Usually, large amounts of lectin are required to fractionate cells on lectin affinity columns. In this paper, we describe an alternate method for isolating Vicia villosa lectin (VVL) without the need for blood group, A substance. In addition, we have coupled V. villosa lectin to chromic chloride-treated sheep erythrocytes and used it as a reagent to both visualize lectin binding lymphocyte popula- tions and to fractionate lectin binding cells rom lectin non-binding cells. Very small amounts of lectin are required for the fractionation procedure (160 Hg lectin per 2 x: 10' cells) and even less for visualization (80 PE lectin for 25 rosette assays). MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Mice of either sex between 6 weeks and 12 weeks of age were used a5 spleen donors. CBA/J, DBA/2J, and BALB/cByJ mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) while C57BL/6JL came from the 0021981.000-000230 o Elevie/North-Holland Biomedical Preu
