Reprinted from the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL, 4 December 1971, 4, 588-590 Effect of Resection of Lung Tumours on the Steroid Abnormalities in Patients with Lung Cancer L.G. S. RAO Summary The urinary cxcretion of androsterone, aetiocholanolone, total 17-oxosteroids, and 17-hydroxycerdicostrolds (17- OHCS) was mcasured in 40 patients with lung cancer three days before resection and again 10-15 days after resection of their lung tumours. There was a significant postoperative increasc in the excretion of 17-OHCS but a significant derase in the excretion of androsterone and actiocholanolone, resulting in an increase of the preoperative abnormalities in steroid excretion A these patients. Since there was no change in steroid crcretion towards normal after resection of the lung tumours, it seems that the steroid abnormalities found in lung cancer are not the cffect of the presence of the lung tumours. As the cxcretions of 17-OHICS aad 11-dcoxy- 17-oxosteroids change in opposite directions after resection, it is. suggested that a lissociation of factors that control the excretion of these two croups of steroids takes place as a response to surgical stress in patients Peychosomatle Rescarch Unlt, Department of Paychological Medi- clae, Southern Generul Hiospital, Glasgow S.W.i L.
