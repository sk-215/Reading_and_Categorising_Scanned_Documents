Sueden: and tNetkonal Velerinury lastitute, The pulmonary carcinogenicity of arsenic trioxide (AS) aone and in combination with benzolaipy rene (BP) was studied in male Syrian golden hamsters given 15 weekly intratra. cheal instillations. The animals were divided into four groups: As. BP, As BP. and controls. At each instillaton about 3 mg'kg body wt as arsetic andior 6 mg'kg body wt of BP was administered. All groups received d carrier dust (charcoal carbon). which increased the lung retention of arsenic. as well as sulfuric acid. Carcinomas of the larynx. trachea, bronchi. or lengs were found in 3, 17. and 25 of 47. 40. and 54 animals examined in the As. BP. and As - BP groups. No respiratory tracicarcinomas wore lound in: 53 control animals. The incidence of pulmonary adenomas, papillomas. and adenomatoid was higheri in the As group thani in the control proup (P < 0.011 Taken together lesions the data markedly provide stronp evidence that arsenic trioxide can induce lung carcinomas. Funhermore. there was some evidence ofa positive interaction between arsenic and BP in relation to adenomatous lung tumors. which could be of importance for the synergim between arsenic and smoking Exposure t0 inorganic arsenic compeunds has been associated with an in- creased incidence of cancer, predominantly in the respiratory system. Epidemi- ological investigations of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers and workers engaged in the production of arsenic-containing pesticides have often revealed positive dose response relationships (Lee and Fraumeni. 1969: Ott et al., 1974; Pinto et al.. 1977; Mabuchi et al.. 19801. Recently, a multiplicative interaction has been indicated between occupational arsenic exposure and smoking in rela- tion to lung cancer among smelter workers (Pershagen et al., 1981). Attempts to induce tumors in laboratory animals with inorganic arsenic com- pounds have mostly failed. Only few studies have. however, involved exposure by the pulmonary route. Ishinishi et al. (1977) found indications of a synergism between arsenic trioxide and benzolalpyrene for lung cancer in rats exposed via intratracheal instillations. No malignant lung tumors were noted in animals given arsenic trioxide only. In a later study Ishinishi et al. (1980) observed one squa- mous cell carcinoma among a total of 19 rats surviving an exposure of 15 week intratracheal instillations of arsenic trioxide. Ivankovic et al. (1979) found malig- nant lung tumors. predominantly adenocarcinomas. in 9 of 15 rats surviving a single intratracheal instillation of a mixture of calcium arsenate, copper sulfate, Pulmonary Route 750 07 Uppsala, Sweden Received: September 24, 1582 e observed in smelter workers.
