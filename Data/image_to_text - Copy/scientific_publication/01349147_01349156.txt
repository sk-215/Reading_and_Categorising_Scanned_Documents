SUMMARY Improved methods have been developed for the determination of nicotine and its major metabolite, cotinine, in blood, plasma, and urine samples. These methods utilize gas chroma- tography with alkali flame ionization (nirogen-phosphorus) detection and structural analogs of nicotine and cotinine as internal standards. INTRODUCTION A variety of methods for the determination of nicotine in biologic specimens have been reported in the literature, including methods based on radioimmuno- assay (1,2], liquid chromatography [3, 4). and gas chromatography using elec- tron-capture (5], flame ionization [6-8], or alkali flame onization (9-12] detectors or combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (13, 14]. In attempting to use publishedi gas chromatographic methods, we encountered dif- ficulty with reproducibility. This paper describes improvedi gas chromato- graphic methods for nicotine and cotinine determination with structural analogs of both substances utilized as internal standerds. Using these methods, concentrations of nicotine as low as 1 ng/ml, and concentrations of cotinine as low as 5 ng/ml may be reliably measured in 1-ml samples of blood, plasma, or unine.
