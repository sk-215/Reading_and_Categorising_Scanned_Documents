Goldman and J. A. Mitchell Detroit, Michigan 48201, U.SA. Departments afAnatomy and Pharmacology, Wayne State University, School of Medicine, Summary. Subcutaneous injection of nicotine (0-5 or 5 mg/kg body wt) resulted in a marked and prolonged reduction in uterine blood flow and intrauterine oxygen tersion in pseudopregnant rats. By 10 min after nicotine administration (5 mg/kg) uterine perfusion was reduced by 40%, remained suppressed for 90 min and returned to the pre-treatment level by 120 min. Rats receiving the 0-5 mg nicotine/kg also showed a marked reduction in uterine blood flow, although the response was slower in onset and longer in duration. Nicotine (5 mg/kg) also resulted in a sustained decrease in intrauterine oxygen tension from a control value of 48-9 + 3-6 to 22-2 + 2-6 mmHg at 45-60 min and 21-7 + 1-5 mmHg at 60-90 min. The frequency and amplitude of fluctuations in intrauterine oxygen tension were still reduced by 90 min after treatment. Introduction Cigarette smoking during pregnancy increases the incidence of abortion, developmental anomalies and small-for-date infants (Hollinshead, 1979). Similarly, in rats, protracted administration of nicotine, an alkaloid of cigarette smoke, causes increased fetal wastage (Hudsor & Timiras, 1972) and small-for-date young (Becker, Little & King, 1968). In addition, injection of the alkaloid during the initial 5 days of pregnancy delays blastocyst implantation (Card a Mitchell, 1979) and retards embryo growth (Hammer & Mitchell, 1979; Yoshinaga, Rice, Krenn & Pilot, 1979). The nicotine- induced suppression of embryo growth is associated with overian steroid hormone imbalance (Yoshinaga et al, 1979) and a marked and protracted reduction in reproductive tract blood flow (Hammer, Mitchell & Goldman, 1981). Since normal conceptus development requires optimal levels of oxygen, the impaired embryo growth observed in nicotine-treated animals may result, in part, from decreased oxygen availability within the reproductive tract. The following study was undertaken to determine whether the nicotine induced reduction in uterine blood flow concomitantly decreases the concentration of oxygen within the uterine lumen. Animals Materials and Methods Mature virgin female rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain (Camm Research Institute), 200-350 8 body weight, were maintained under environmental conditions controlled with respect to room temperature (20-25Â°C), humidity (40-60%) and photoperiod (14 h light Reprint requests to Dr LA.
