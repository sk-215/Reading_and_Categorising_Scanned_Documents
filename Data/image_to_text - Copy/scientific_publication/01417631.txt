A range of cigarettes, tobacco types and smoke Penetration of smoke into the lungs was clearly demonstrated, and loads of total particulate matter (TPM) of up 1 mg were detected in the lower respiratory system of rats. The mass of TPM deposited was affected by the Deposition of TPM in the head of the rat was low in relation to total respiratory system deposition. A pattern of predominantly lung deposition was achieved under the conditions used for this series of experiments. This pattern was not affected by changes in smoke dilution level, cigarette or concentrations was used. smoke concentration during exposure. tobacco typ. INTRODUCTION The rat is currently being used extensively in a number of laboratories carrying out inhalation toxicity studies with tobacco smoke. The work reported in this paper is concerned with particulate deposition in rats sub- jected to smoke in a new inhalation machine.
