Further analysis of the results were rare in the Slonaker rats. The latter survived much longer and in them, at a later date, bladder tumours developed in high yicld. The rate of appearance of such lesions was not, in fact, very different in rats of the two strains. No pre-existing lesions were found in the intestinal tract of the Wistar rats such as might localise the action of a circulating carcinogen, and an alternative The factors involved in the induction of bladder tumours in rats are discussed.
