Studies both abroad and in the United States have determined that cigarette advertising plays a minimal role in an individual's decision to smoke. Peer influence, and the influence of parents and older siblings, is by far the dominant factor. Banning advertising, therefore, will not affect the incidence of smoking Besides being ill-suited to achieve its stated purpose, this proposal is unconstitutional. Since the 1970's, the courts have ruled that commercial speech is protected under the First Amendment. Unfortunately, by the time the courts get around to overturning this measure, the economic damage will already have been done to my industry and many II hope you will take the above into consideration and oppose the passage of Assembly the promotional marketing and advertising industries. newspapers or magazines. by youths. others. Bill 7139. Sincere FL Christopher J. Ferraro Vice President, Marketing ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING, INC. CJF/sa
