May 21, 1964 Mr. T. E. Cartee Leaf Process Engineering Rat Test Results on Incinerator Operation While Burning Vapor from Four Treater Lines at Building 605-1 During Week of May 4-8, 1964 The accompanying table shows that aicotine ean be ineinerated satisfactorily at furnace temperatures above 1790° F. with an oxygen content of 8% in the effluent gas from the ineineration process. Hovever, it appears that temperatures of 2000° 7. are desirable to destroy 99% of the amonia fed to the incinerator when all four treater 1ines are operated with a steam flow of 44,000 1bs./hr. Previously, tests at 1900° T. temper- ature with only two treater lines running have showa satisfactory inciner- closed) appears to supply sufficient air for incineration since a large amount of air leakage also occurred. However, in order to avoid butterfly valve leakage it appears necessary to use the damper almost wide open. Otherwise there is an odor of anmonia and nicotine in the stack gas. It is possible that better distribution of air to the so" and 48" valves could reduce the valve leakages but since the tests shoved that satis- factory results could be obtained when using the toxic air fan at full capacity, no adjustments vere attempted in the limited tims. ation of ammonia. Using the Toxic Air Fan at about 70% of capacity (damper half During the five-day test with vapor from four treater lines, gas fuel was used on 3-3/4 days and oil fuel on 1-1/4 days. Over-all fuel consumption for the week averaged the equivalent of about 55 gal./hr. while incinerator was ruming. Only 30-40 gai./hr. oil equivalent was needed after incinerator reached equilibriun with vapor flow from four treatar lines. Prorating the over-all fuel requirement showss 3.7 gal. oil per 1000 lbs., tobacco for the test reported here; approximstely 8.8 gal. oil per 1000 lbe. tobacco for a mouth of operation with only tvo treater 1ines running but vith a much larger excess of air in the incinerators and about 10.9 gal. oil per hour per 1000 lbs. tobacco for 1963 when the Thermal Research ineinerator was in use. It ie believed that the fuel requirement when running only two treaters can be reduced appreciably from the 8.8 gal. per 1000 1bs. of tobacco by reducing excess air flow to the ineinerator. An appreciable amount of this reduction can be accouplished by removal of four of the eight incinerator buraers which are not needed but which require large flow of cooling air at all times. Other sources of uncontrolled air leakage also need elimination insofar as possible. 55
