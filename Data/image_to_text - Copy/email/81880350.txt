In general, the process is fairly simple. Ve forward a letter to the appropriate contact and follow up by phone to ansver any questions and to secure the proclanation Sonetimes. we are asked to submit additional information. In 1999, ve were able to secure proclamations in najor markets including Chicago, Dallas and Philly. In our experience, and the experiences of our colleagues on the 100-city Milk Mustache Tour who often secure proclanations, mayors rarely refuse these requests. That said. there are no guarantees and we d appreciate anything that Steve can do to help us make this happen. When you ve spoken with Steve, let's discuss how you'd like u3 to proceed. Perhaps, we can submit our request to get the ball rolling and Steve can use his contacts to push 1t through Let us know. Thanks. attl. .htm -MAYORDOC 81880350
