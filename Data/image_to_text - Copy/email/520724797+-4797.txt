(MSM USA) RJR Research: Publications & Presentations Tuesday, March 18, 1997 10:20AM During our interview with Phoebe Zerwick for her RJRT/Bowman Gray School of Medicine story, we indicated that RJR scientists had published several hundred journal articles in the past few years. Mostly out of curiosity, - asked Helen Chung in the R&D library to update the numbers I pulled during the recon issue days; the attached captures her response. Figuring the stats might as well be complete, I also got patent counts from Gus Borschke. Idid not P this document to Phoebe (in the end, she wasn't really interested in the numbers anyway). But here Rive is in case the information is ever helpful to you. < <File Attachment: RJRPUBL.DOC>: > lD  Page 1
