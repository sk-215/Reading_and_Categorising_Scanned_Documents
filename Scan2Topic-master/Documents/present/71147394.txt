Team members in attendance were: Rick Baker, Edgard Aguilar, Bryan Hudson, Frank Fain, Ron Dawson, Mark Loyd Sr., Pat Kirchner, Dave Gollihue, Paul Nielander, Mike Diven & Tim Essentially the team reviewed the A.T. Kearney Icarus presentation/report from Wednesday, 10/2. The team decided what should be presented to the senior management group on Monday, 10/7. This 2nd presentation was scheduled due to a request by Bob Bexon, who was out of town this week but very much wanted to see the findings from this update. Attendees are: Bob Bexon, Mark Kovatch, Walt Carpenter & Glenn Korfhage. However, anyone from the Kaleidoscope team who missed this weeks presentation is invited to attend as well. This presentation will be in Tobacco Row from 2:00 - 4:30 With a little over 1 week left to complete this project (must be completed & prepared to present by 10/16), Mike Diven & I have been pulling together a preliminary report. Team members present today were given this document for their review and I have attached it to this cc:Mail for those of you who could not attend today (timtmp.ppt). Please review the layout (i.e. Driver, Advantages, Disadvantages, Potential Threat To The Industry & Conclusion) and see if it makes sense. We were only able to complete the Assumptions k Master Distributors section, but will complete sections for Exclusive Distributors & Direct Store Delivery in time for next Monday's Kaleidoscope meeting. Please review what we have to-date prior to the Bennett. pm. Monday (10/7) meeting. That's it for now. Thanks, Tim 210100410 PRODUCED FROM B&W WEB SITE
