This is in reply to your letter of July 28 concerning use of Lithium Report 71-9 provides all results we have to date on che influence of lithium tracer ou subjective properties of cigarettes: Presently, we do not use the technique in full scale production studies but plan to obtain more information via WOODROSE and consumer product testing; this will take cons: iderable time. In light of your current incerest, you may vish to determine, yourself, the consumer acceptance of your products with the tracer present. We would appreciate any supportive Our studies vith traccr on the breakup of reconstituted sheets continue, but are handicapped by our inability to go to full scale production tests. Our tentative reaults from senll sample preparation, reported in tha last quarterly, indicate PJS to be more sensitive to breakup than PCL as we use these processes. Further tests are underway, once again small sample preparation, to better estimate che magnitude the tracer approach is the only one we can suggest for blend studies. The lichium technique was the result of a long search. work you can accomplish on tracer utilization. of the observed differences. Sincerely, R. A. Sanford RAS/bfu cc: Dr. I. W. Hughes -
