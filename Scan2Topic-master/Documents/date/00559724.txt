Number 24. Dear Executive: MAXIMIZATION OF SALES FORCE. POTENTIAL ESSENTIAL. Timing excellent for marketers to establish beachheads in new markets via aggressive sales strategies. Alert market- ing v-p recognizes sales (supported by advertising, merchandising, promotion) as pri- mary force in today's marketing environment. Establishes guidelines for evaluating territory, account assignments. Determines effectiveness of commission vs. direct sales force. E.g., American Maize Products' S.A. Schonbrunn &e Co. subsidiary switched from direct to commission sales force (except in N.Y.C.) after study revealed supermarkets major growth potential for company's coffee products (Savarin, El Pico, Medaglia d'Oro) vs. independent food stores. Hudson Pulp & Paper chief Dave Mazer. nmaximizes use of sales ex- ecutives. Company's four sales forces function as 1) "intelligence networks" (salesmen in position to spot buying trends in advance); 2) problem solvers (for customers as well as for internal needs like scheduling production); 3) nev market developers (sales ex- ecutives instrumental in company's entry into specialized plastics field). Sales force cutbacks to accelerate. GR predicts rise in rate of sales force layoffs over next five years. Marginal producers first to go. Reasons: continued rise in pay-: roll taxes plus legislation introduced in Congress by Rep. John McCollister (R., Nebr.) calling for indemnification of sales representatives terminated for reasons than good cause" : (e.g., fraud, dishonesty, criminal activity). (H.R. 11 establish- es system of minimum compensation after termination ranging from one-half of 1% of sales generated from new account brought in by terminated salesman after 18 months to 5 years of service to 1% of sales for over five years of service.)

REYNOIDS TOBACCO TESTS FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. R.J. Reynolds Industries subsidiary president Bill Hobbs plays with fire via outdoor advertising campaign for recent introduction of 120-millimeter More cigaret. (More gains 1% of U.S. cigaret market since January 1975 debut.) Reymolds utilizes billboard proximity to college campuses, military basesito promote More to youth market. Look for Reynolds strategy to raise Federal Trade Commission (FTC) dander. (Cigaret ads knocked off tv by Federal Communications Commission due to mass exposure to youth market plus smoking health hazard.) Current errorts by FIC to expand cigaret health warning on outdoor billboard to 25%-of ad space increases antagonism between Federal agency, cigaret industry. Look for pressure to mount for cigaret advertisers to withdraw from out- door medium (R.J. Reynolds spends $15 million in outdoor advertising). ITT BEEFS UP OVERSEAS ADVERTISING EFFORT. Ad director John Lowden directs $45 million ad campaign to 1) mitin ITT leadership in telecommunications, elec- tronics fields; 4 increase sales for ITT Consumer Products division; 3) build 1 other reports, financial statements of customers). in rm withant witton nermieelnn.
