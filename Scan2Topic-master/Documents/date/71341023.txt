John BNILCUSMIRUSBATOGAT Fanon POPpILOUISMIIE/USEAT 09/15/99 05:04:51 PM Research FOB's Required Copy Mark Just to follow up, - spoke with John yesterday regarding the necessary legal copy and the artwork for the unbranded FOB's that will be manufactured in Macon for the Quality Research. John has existing artwork for a soft pack structure that could be picked up and dropped onto a KS FOB structure. The only additional information he would need from us are the "codes" we would want to use for each pack version. We had discussed using "smart" codes such as: 1119B (11 pt. Board/194 Foil/ZBA film) 1125S (11 pt. Board/25# Foil/ZSA film) 1219B (12 pt. Board/19# Foil/ZBA film) 1425S (14 pt. Board/19# Foil/ZSA film) If you and Robert have an opportunity to discuss what the appropriate coding should be and could pass that on to John this week, we could move forward with the necessery art and cylinders for the FOB's.
