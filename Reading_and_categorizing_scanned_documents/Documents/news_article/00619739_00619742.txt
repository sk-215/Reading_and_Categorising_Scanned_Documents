317A HFR SMOKING 2/18 WA ADV FOR AM'S WED 26 OR THEREAFTER 3RD OF THREE THE CIGARETTE CONTR OVERSY EDITOR'S NOTE: CAN THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY COME UP WITH A "SAFE" CIGARETTE? THIS MULTIBILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IS EXPLORED IN THE FOLLOWING DISPATCH, LAST OF THREE ON THE PROS AND CONS OF THE SHOKING-AND-HEALTH CONTROVERSY, BY WILLIAM B. MEAD RICHMOND, VA. (UPI) --YOU TAP ONE OUT OF THE PACK, PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH, AND DRAW. YOU FIND YOURSELF INHALING A LUNG FULL OF SMOKE- "THAT'S WHAT ITS LIKE TO "SMOKE" ONE OF THE PLASTIC IMITATION CIGARETTES UNDER STUDY BY TOBACCO INDUSTRY RESEARCHERS. "MUCH OF THE RESEARCH ON OUR PART IS DEFENSIVE, e EXPLAINED FLAVORED FOG. DR. HELMUT WAKEHAM, A NONSMOKING CHEMIST WHO RUNS PRILIP MORRIS, INC.'S MODERN LABORATORY HERE. "I'VE GOT TO BE PREPARED. ." NO TOBACCO COMPANY WANTS TO MAKE AN IMITATION CIGARETTE. WAKEHAM AND HIS COLLEAGUES WOULD MUCH PREFER TO IDENTIFY AND REMOVE ANY HARMPUL ELENENTS IN REAL CIGARETTE SMOKE, BUT GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY EXPERTS, AGREZ THAT SUCCESS IN THAT ENDEAVOR IS NOT NOW IN-SIGHT. "WE'RE IN A QUANDR Y WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT,' P WAKZRAM TOLD A VISITING REPORTER OF THE SMOKING AND HEALTH CONTROVERSY. "WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT CHEMICALS TO PUT OUR FINGER ON. H WE COULD PINPOINT THEM, WE THINK WE COULD GET THEM OUT." MOIYAZR WAKEHAN NOR HIS INDUSTRY COLLEAGUES ACCEPT THE GOVERIMENT'S ASSERTION THAT SMOKING KILLS. BUT THEY FACE THE REALITY OF A STRONG ANTISMOKING DRIVE WHICH COULD RASTICALLY REOUCE CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION AND MAKE A SUBSTITUTE FEASIBLE.
