Reply separator Subject: Date: Author: Elmer Litzinger at BWMRD1 8/9/95 10:43 AM Mike, from yesterday's a meeting on leaf aging plans, you expressed a desire to apply what you learned from the "Strategy of Experimentation" course to creating a multiple response surface design for the work on prizing and PG and urea experiments. Please feel free to do so but contact Bob Denier and Paul Chen for a meeting with you, Kevin and me. Also, keep in mind logical upper levels for PG and urea to avoid "limp as a dish rag" PG treated whole leaf for threshing as well as excessive urea. Elmer 405000021
