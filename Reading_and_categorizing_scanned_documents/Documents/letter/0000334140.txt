WESTMINSTER HOUSE 7 MILLBANK LONDON swir 3JE 01-222 1222 PERSONAL Mr. F,R. Kiernan, P.O, Box 659, Louisville, Kentucky 40201. Dear Frank, 13th March, 1973, REC'D MAR 19 1973 F.R. K. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, We are rather interested here in some of the reported activities of United States trade unions in respect of investments in South Africa, We understand that Reynolds dropped their intention of setting up a manufacturing unit in South Africa under union pressure. We also hear that several American companies, for example General Motors and Polaroid, have been under U.S. union pressure on two counts: (a) to greatly improve pay rates to Africans in the companies' existing subsidiaries in South Africa, (b) to withdraw from that country. one hand, political pressure from a particular group to improve African conditions; on the other hand, a desire to protect home jobs instead of promoting development overseas. However, we are. interested in this sort of activity because there is general international union activity aimed at the big international companies and because we have information about a projected world congress of unions from B.A, T. 's tobacco Interests in the autumn of this year. In general, experience shows that these jamborees make a lot of political noise and tend to break down when it com es to useful action, However, one must have in mind such possibilities as a negro boycott of KOOL in the U,S. if we continued with a South African operation. Not a pleasant thought and probably unlikely to occur but you never know One can sce two elements to this sort of pressure, On the these days : Hence, any information you may be able to let us have about union attitudes to South African subsidiaries would be extremely helpful, With kind regards, Yours sincerely, Lali Ary Ce beues brral?
