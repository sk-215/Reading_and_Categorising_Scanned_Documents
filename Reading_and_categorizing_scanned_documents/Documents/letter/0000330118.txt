THE AMERICAN TOBACCO COMPANY 150 BART 42we STREBT. Naw YORK, N.Y. 10017 Ornen or n PRRRDENT CRAIRMAX axD or TRE JOARD August 5, 1965 Mr. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger President and Publisher The New York Times Times Square New York, New York Dear Mr. Sulzberger: Thank you for sending me with your letter of August 2,. 1965, the "analysis" by your editorial board of my letter of July 13, 1965, protesting as grossly mis- leading your editorial of July 9, 1965, entitled "Cigarettes vs. FTC.". You say in your letter accom- panying the "analysis" that you and your associates feel that your editorial position is sound. Your editorial board's report simply attempts to justify. and rationalize that position, which fundamentally and for some time has appeared to be anti-cigarette, regardless. Although I see nothing to be gained by a protracted correspondence between us on the subject of your editorial of July 9, I think I should advise you briefly that the answer to my letter of July 13 prepared by your editors is completely unconvincing Without going into every point at 1ssue, I think it should be evident that the statement you published that the new federal legislation "forbids : the F.T.C. : from regulating cigarette advertising in any way for the next four years" is just plain wrong. The best indication of this is the r√©cent notice by the F.T.C. that "it will continue to monitor current practices and methods of cigarette advertising and promotion and take all appropriate action consistent with the Act to prohibit cigarette advertising that violates the Federal Trade Commission Act" (Federal Register, July 29, 1965, pages 9484-9485). to us.
