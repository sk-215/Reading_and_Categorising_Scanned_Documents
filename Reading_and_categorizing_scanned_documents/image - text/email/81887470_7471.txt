Jordan: Please let us know what the "powers that be" say. We're happy to work with Larsen to develop a banner with pre-approved creative, like the skatcboard kid, if they'rc uncomfortable moving forward with this alternative look. Thanks.

I'm going to have to scck a substantial amount of socond opinion internally before I commit. I will let you know as soon as I receive Jason/Katy to speed approvals, it's typically best to use existing creative elements rather than devising new ones. For example. ifyou were looking for a "boarding" motif, we could have created something using our "skateboard kid" creative from earlier in the campaign (Katy can share with you an example). This surf idca is certainly timcly, but I'm curious to scC ift the "powers that be" arc looking to changc our crcative so drastically, with a pretly substantial frame. that feedback. change already due later this year.
