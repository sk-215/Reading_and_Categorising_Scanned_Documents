Dr CJ Whelan Department of Blosciences, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane, Hatfield Herts. Summary Nicotine has a protective action in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. We have been able to mimic the anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine in TNBS-induced colitis in laboratory animals by the addition of nicotine to the drinking water( see report Feb-July 1998). Using funding from BAT industries, we have investigated possible mechanisms by which nicotine may produce this effect in animals and in man. We have established that nicotine has no inhibitory effect on interleukin-2 generation by rat splenic lymphocytes, on mediator release by rat mast cells or on the adhesion to plastic of THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line. However, nicotine is a potent inhibitor of LPS-induced cytokine release from THP-1 cells. Nicotine caused a concentration-related inhibition of the release of tumour necrosis factor a, (TNFa), Interferon 9 (IFNg) and Interleukin-8 (IL-8).
