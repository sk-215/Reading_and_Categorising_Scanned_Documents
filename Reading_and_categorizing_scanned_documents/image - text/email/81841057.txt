This leaves Lorillard with two spots for rotation ("Piercing Parlor" and "Sneaking Out") within this network's programming. In the past, when ABC didn't clear "Piercing Parlor", the Agency was directed Lo remove all inventory from ABC until all our spots cleared. In deference to this, we are concerned about possibly removing Cartoon Network, as it would be a challenge for the buyers to make up the points lost with similar CPMS on another network. As the attached document shows, the Cartoon Network accounts for one of the lowest CPMS in the 1st Quarter. We also have a large amount of dollars allocated to the network ($216,750 - 298 of budget) totaling 67 GRPS (354 of Budget) for both quarters combined. We feel that it would benefit Lorillard's Youth Smoking Prevention Program to make an exception in this case, and run "Piercing Parlor" and "Sneaking Out" on Cartoon Network. Please note, the buyers also currently have $257,593 net put aside for the potential addition of MTV in the 2nd Quarter, as we are still determining the timetable for the launch of Lorillard's new creative. Please let us know if you would like to set up a time to discuss our current position on this front. Thanks, -Dave 10-2Q Teen Cable Summaryxs 81841057
