I can't find where we received this... Can you please respond to the questions below so we can develop the advertising for these displays. WT Reply Separa tor Subject: Cub Foods Aut thor: Francine McCubbins at BWLPAC7 Da te: : 11/15/95 3:27 PM On the above, the last note I had in my file was that Richard Brown was going to send us a sample for material. Have you ever received anything from him? I am going to go ahead and spec this the same as our regular poster mat terial. Please let me know asap if this is not right. Also, I don't have an "official" cms request for this one so I don't know shipping and case packing. Do you have that info? Thanks. 210350349 PRODUCED FROM B&W WEB SITE
