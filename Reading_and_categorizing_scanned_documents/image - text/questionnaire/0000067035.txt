Deines Dupont KOOL and Salem smokers evaluated ease of draw for KOOL 100 and Salem 100. KOOL 100 has higher lit pressure drops than Salem 100 when measured by machine; this was detected by KOOL smokers but generally not by Salem smokers. INTRODUCTION Full flavor KS/100 menthol smokers evaluated KOOL 100 and Salem 100 to determine if differences in lit pressure drops are perceived by consume: rs (Figure 1, ref. Memo B132-82 from J. M. Brawner, 10/25/82). Panelists first smoked the cigarettes monadically and rated ease of draw for the first and second halves; no differences emerged except Salem KS smokers judged the first half of Salem 100 harder to draw Next, in paired comparisons, the only differences found were by KOOL KS/100 smokers combined. During both the first and second halves, KOOL 100 was judged harder to draw than comparable portions of Salem Finally, in an effort to put into context any perceived differences in draw, panelists made paired comparisons and judged which cigarette had the "best" draw. (It was recognized a priori that overall liking of a cigarette might influence judgments of "draw preference".) As shown in Figure 4, KOOL smokers like KOOL's draw best; Salem smokers like Salem's draw best. Interestingly, although the KOOL smokers had judged KOOL hardest to draw, they still preferred its draw characteristics (or preferred it overall). If the latter is true, it is the first evidence among Dupont menthol smokers of preference for than the last half of KOOL 100 (Figure 2). 100 (Figure 3). "own" brand in blind testing.
