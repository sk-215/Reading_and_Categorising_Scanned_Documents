W. Ayer & Son Inc. 30 Rockefeller Plaza New York, New York Dear Newt: Last week marked the introduction of the new Philip Morris in the states of California, Oregon and Nevada. We consider it most signifi- cant tha at we have chosen newspapers as the basic medium to promo te this revolutionary packaging of a popular-price cigarette. Philip Morris Inc. has historically used newspapers to great extent in its promotional efforts. The heavy roles played by newspapers in our "Changing our Dress" campaign and in the recent Marlb boro schedules are examples of the import we attach to the medium. There are two primary reasons for this: 1. The conc en tration of effort afforded by local media. 2. The scope of merchandising services offered by news- papers. In the past, we have enjoyed outstanding merchandising support from the newspapers selected for the current schedule of large-space insertions. Since this is the first campaign placed for Philip Morris through N.W. Ayer & Son Inc., we strongly recommend tha t you seek the newspapers' cooperation and support in this regard. All of us at Philip Morris will be eager to review the merchandising support accorded us by the newspapers and their efforts will be greatly appreciated. Cordially, John T.
