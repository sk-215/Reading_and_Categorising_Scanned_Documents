Homburger Bio-Research Institute Cambridge, Massachusetts Dear Dr. Homburger: 02141 The ICR mice arrived from ARS/Sprague-Dawley and we had the tissues test ted for gs antigen by Dr. Huebner's laboratory and the sera of the retired breeders tested for their viral antibody spec- trum by Dr. Parker at Microbiological Associates, Inc. The sera were all negative for PVM, Reo 3, GS VII, K, Polyoma, KRV, H-1, SV5: M.Ad, LCM and Vaccinia. Seven of the eleven mice showed HAI titers of 1:10 to 1:40 for Sendi. Nine of the eleven mice showed titers of 1:80 to 1:640 for MVM. Three of the eleven mice The gs antigen CF results are presented in the attached table. It would appear that these mice are very swi tched-on for gs antigen even as weanlings. This makes it very difficult to evaluate any effects that chemical carcinogens may have on the spleen, thymus or liver tissues although studies for the presence of gs antigen in the tumors could still be done. A mouse strain showing less gs antigen would serve our purpose better for some future studies. gave 1:10 to 1:20 CF titers for MHV. Sincerely yours, - aoci  Ho Carrie E.
