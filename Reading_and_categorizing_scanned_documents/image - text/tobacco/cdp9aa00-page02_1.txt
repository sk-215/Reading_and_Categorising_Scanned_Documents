Hockett, Ph.D., The Council for Tobacco Research, 110 East 59th Street, New York, N.Y. 10022 Dear Doctor Hockett: U.S.A. Safely back in Winnipeg where we are shivering in -20Â° weather, I wish to thank you for inviting me to the conference on the macrophage. Taken as a whole I thought the conference was valuable although I mus t admit to some synaptic overload during the first part of the Friday morning session. As I left you asked for comments, so perhaps I may pinpoint the particula On the first day, the work of Jose eph Guarneri continues to impress me ; areas that impressed me, here is a wealth and depth of knowledge and the combination of in-vivo and vitro models has much to offer in the elucidation of disturbed macrophagic function. It became clear, as the discussion progressed, that there are significant gaps in our knowledge about bactericidal mechanisms in the lung. Is it related solely to the macrophage or are vther factors such as surfactant involved too? course, very beautifully presented. I think it was interesting to see the surface changes in the adapted or angry macrophages but the long range significance of this is doubtful. S.E.M. may perhaps, because of its low magnificaticn, be of some use in quantitative studies, but I don't see it as a major investigative tool. important parameter, the metabolic adaptive changes that occur when the macrophage is irritated in any way. It is important to look at the mac rophage in this ince it is becoming apparent that the adaptive capacity of the macrophage is way great and only when this capacity is excecded may wC expect trcuble. The two papers on scanning electron microscopy were fascinating and, of After lunch on Thursday, the papers of Cross and Mus taf fa emphasized an
