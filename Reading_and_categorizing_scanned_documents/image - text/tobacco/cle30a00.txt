The meeting at the Dorado Beach Hotel was very good and we certainly appreciated the opportunity to visit an off- shore island. My expenses associated with the trip are small; one requires explanation and it may not be allowable. The plane from Minneapolis left for San Juan at 07.30; this meant travelling from Winnipeg the previous evening and taking an hotel near the airport. I have enclosed the bill for this expenditure. EXPENSES: Taxis to and from Winnipeg airport: $ 20 $117.45 $137.45 i Hotel at Minneapolis: TOTAL Now I get down to the grant reviews for the April meeting. - - - / / - T4PSLISE With best wishes, Sincerely 3768H3 41 Check # and Dale Apso.s for Payment AF: Vouc : Acccunt # a Calculations Veilie 6,600 nelivery Drummond H.
