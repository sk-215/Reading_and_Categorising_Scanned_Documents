Goodson, Winston Leaf submitted three types of flue-cured It was our understanding they were to be investigated as supplements for the AO-1 Argentine flue-cured blend presently utilized in their King, Commande and possibly the mild charcoal filter blends Based on this assumption they were smoked individually against the Argentine flue-cured by the Internation Expert Panel. In their opinion grade AFD-SFD (R.J.R.-3) was equivalent to AO-1 in flavor and aroma while AF4S (R.J.R.-3) had similar characteristics, less overall flavor. However, they felt both could be utilized as supplemer to AO-1 but not as a total replacement. The JDS (R.J.R.-6) was rejected Co The R.J.R. grades were assigned by Mr. John Hutcheson and the only reason JDS was graded 6 was based on color and texture. Further evaluations were tobaccos for quality evaluation, by Tobacco Development. pletely due to the low flue-cured flavor and aroma. carried out by Mr. Hutcheson under TL-452. - - - - ceste R. D.
