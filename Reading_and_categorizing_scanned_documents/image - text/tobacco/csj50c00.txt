PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES INC. 120 PARK AVENUE NEW YORK, NY 10017-5592 GEOFFREY C. BIBLE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER I am pleased to present you with a copy of our 1997 Annual Report. As you read it, you will see why I believe that we stand at the threshold of a new era. Last year, we broke new ground in an attempt to resolve controversial issues facing our domestic tobacco business, as well as achieved other goals for our businesses and our shareholders. We believe that last year's proposed legislative resolution of many litigation and regulatory issues facing the United States tobacco industry can restore a measure of stability to our environment, SO that we can properly be valued as an outstanding growth company, an employer of choice and a good corporate citizen. - I am proud to have you with us as we work to resolve important public policy issues, while responsibly and vigorously building our businesses and increasing returns to our investors.
