Thomas Senior Immunologist IIT Research Institute 10 West 35th Street Chicago, IL 60616 Dear Dr. Thomas: We have completed our review of several Immunomodulatory Screen- ing Tests, recently submitted to Lorillard, and have the follow- ing comments and corrections: SN35LOR (A155) Page 12, Table 2: The outlier indicated by footnote b is missing from the table. Please indicate where this footnote belongs, or remove the footnote notation if an outlier was not present. Page 5, Section IIA, line 2: Please correct the spelling of SN38LOR (A81) August.

Perhaps this section would read better if it began with a discussion of the unexpected mortality caused by the Test Article, fol- lowed by what was observed in the surviving animals.

Just prior to death the mice experienced hyperkine- tic activity. An autopsy of one mouse in the 1250 mg/kg aose group revealed a lighter than normal liver color with a iter texture. Body weights of surviving mice were mea- sured on dosing day 3 and 5 and were not different from vehicle controls. Table 1, summarizes the results of the example:
