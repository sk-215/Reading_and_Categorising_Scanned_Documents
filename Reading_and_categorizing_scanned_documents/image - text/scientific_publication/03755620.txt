(Receired 15Janwary 1980) The body of adenovirus fiber messenger RSA is spreified by viral rstrand eo-ordinates 86-2 to 91-2. Since thas mRNA is transcribed from the majos late promoter a: map position 16, nuclear precursors to the mRNA could be M large M 84% of the length of the 35,000 nucleotide genome. Thas study identified and characterized polyadenylated nuclear RNAs that eontain fiber sequence and therefore are possible processing intermediates. These nuclear RNAS were characterized by hybridization of PHIRNA preparatinns and by electron miercacopy of RNA-DNA hybrids. Three size claxaes of RNAs containang fiber sequences were identified: (1) a 22 S species maps from 8621 10 90: 3. This RNA has eseentially the ssme co-ordinates aa fiber mRNA (2) Two 28S *pecies have co-ordinates of 80 to 90 and 85 91 to 96-9. respeetively. Thus one species has 5' terminus eoincident with that of the mRNA body, and one has a 3" terminus eoincident with that of the 3 end of the mRNA body. The polyadenylated terminus at 96-9 does not coincide with the 3' end of any knonn mRNA. (3) There are at lenst two 35: S species. The 3 end of one species : coineudent with that offiber mRNA. The 3' terminus oft the second RNA 18 al approximstely 96 9. The labeling kineties of each of these polya adenylated nuclear RNAS were investigated. In continuous label experiments, the two 35S RXAs and thr 85-9 to 96-9 281 S RSA became uniformly labeled in approximately 60 minutes. The 22 S RNA and the 60- to 90-4 28 S species continued to accumulste for at leant arveral hours These resulta are consistent with a precursor funetinn for the 355 RNAS and the 85-9 to 961 e 28 S species. The atruetures of the putative precursors imply that processing oft the 3' end 15 not : prerequisite for 5 cleavape. During the late phase of adenovirus infection, transeription of aa 30,000 nucleotide region is under the control of one major prumoter located at genome position 16 (Evans et al, 1977; Weber et al, 1977; Goldberg et al, 1977). Within this transeription unit (genome positions 161 to 100) at least 13 messenger RNAs are synthesized The majority ofthese mRNAS are arranged in five families that share common 3'.terminal sequences but vary in length (MeGrogan & Raskas, 1978; Ziff a Fraser, 1978; Fraser & Ziff. 1978: Nevins a Darnell, 1978a). All of these RNAs are polyadenylated (Philipson et al., 1. Introduction 149 0012-183680/29240-17 s02 00/0 o 1050 Academie Prees Ine. (London) Led
