EFFECTS OF WEATHERING AND FLUE-CURING ON METHOMYL RESIDUES ON TOBACCO" R. B. LEIDY,J.J. DOMANSKI, P. L. HAIRE, andT.J. SHEETS North Carolina. Saate University Raleigh, North Carolina 27607 A replicated field experiment was conducted at (wo locations to determine the disappear ance of methomylfrom flue-cured tobacco. Immediately after application, methomyl residues were 88 and 113 ppin ati Clayton and. 44 and 105 ppm at Reidsville, respectively, for 0.56 and 1.12 kg/ha application rates. After 5 days these levels dropped to 0.7 and 2.8 ppm at Clayton and 1.4 and 4.11 ppm at Reidsville. At 9 days alter. application, 99% of the methomyli had disappearedlat bothlocations. Losses of methomy! during flue-curing averaged 96% over cations, rates of: application, and times of harvest, compared to an average ioss of 98% due weathering in the ficld for: 5 days. The disappearance of methomyl during the curing proces: Methomyli (S-methyl-W-(methylcarbamoyljoxy thioacetimidate) has been used to con trol tobacco insects since 1970, but few data on residue levels after application have becn published.. Tappan et al.. (1973) reported that residue levels of methomyl on flue-cured tobacco 5 days after application ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 ppm. Surface applications ofan aqueous solution of "C-labeled methomyl to cotton leaves showed that 6.8, 1.8, and 0.0% of the residues remained at 24, 48, and 96 hr after treatmment, respectively (Bull 1974). Metabolic studies with "C-labeled methomyl in. tobacco (Harvey and Reiser 1973) and soil (Harvey andi Pease 1973) showed that this compound rapidly degraded to CO, with the remainder of "C activity being incorporated into natural plant components and with traces of very polar compounds being formed in soil. Rceves and Woodham (1974) detected methomyl residues as low as 0.05 ppm in tobacco using a gas-liquid chromatog raph equipped with a flame photometric detector in the sulfur mode. This study was conducted (a) to determine the effects of weathering and fue-curing or residuc levels of methomyl on tobacco, (b) to ascertain if the preharvest interval could be reduced from the established 7 days, and (c) to verify the safety of the reentry period. Agricultural practices suggested by the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Sta- tion were. employed from the time of seed bed preparation to the time of methomyl appli- 'Paper No. 4645 of the Journal Series of the Nonth Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station, Ralcigh, North was approximately the: same for both locations.
