References 318 321 323 326 327 In recent years interest in the study of chemical carcinogens has increased and investigators in this field are devoting consider- able time, thought and experimentation to methodologic problems not hitherto thoroughly explored. Many discussion meetings such as the Gordon Conference and two sessions sponsored by the Tobac- co Industry Research Committee have been held and their deliber- ations, while unpublished, have had impact on the work of those in this field. An issue of the British Medical Bulletin (MAY, 1958) has been largely devoted to this problem, and a recent Ciba Foundation Symposium from which we shall repeatedly quote below, has re- vealed the thinking of a group of workers from eleven countries on the subject of Carcinogenesis: Mechanisms of Action, WOLSTEN- The present state of. knowledge or ignorance- -in this field has been succinctly summarized by I. HIEGER (loc. cit. 1959) as follows: "While we have at present a number of theories of carcinogenesis, These studies supported, in part, by grants from the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, New York, N. Y., and by a Public Health Service Research Grant (C4338) from the National Cancer Institute, U. S. Public Health Service. HOLME AND O'CONNOR (1959).
