Industrial grade samples ofbis- (chloromethyl) ether and chloromethyl methyl ether were injected sub- cutaneously into newborn ICR Swiss mice at a maximum tolerated dose. Bis(chloromethyl) ether, dissolved in peanut oil, was injected at a dose of 12.5 ul/kg, chloromethyl methyl ether at 125, ul/kg, and the vehicle control mice received 0.05 ml of peanut oil only. The positive control animals The animals were sacrificed 6 months posttreatment, and the lung adenoma incidence was determined. Vehicle control animals had an incid- ence of 147 % with a mean number per animal of0,14. An incidence of 100% and mean of 17 was observed in the positive control animals receiving urethan. The animals receiving bis(chloromethyl) ether had an incidence of 45% with a mean of 0.64 each parameter significantly higher than the control values. The animals receiving chloromethyl methyi ether had an incidence of 17% with a mean of 0.21- -high but not significantly different It has been recognized for a number of years that some of the most potent chemical mutagens are alkylating agents (Auerbach, 1967). Druckrey et al. (1966) have recently reviewed the carcinogenic effects of alkylating chemicals in rodents and also have reported lung carcinoma in industrial workers exposed to dimethyl sulfate, a widely Van Duuren er al. (1968) investigated bis(chloromethyl) ether and chloromethyl methylether in long-term dermal application studies in mice and repeated subcutancous injections in rats. Thescinvestigators found bis(chloromethyl) ether a potent carcinogen for mouse skin, inducing 13 papillomas in 20 mice. Twelve of these lesions progressed to squamous cell carcinomas in 325 days. Their preliminary results with repeated sub- cutaneous injections of bis(chloromethyl) ether showed 3 tumors (2 fibrosarcomas and 1 fibroma) in rats which had died and palpable lesions in 11 surviving rats. While no tumors had bcen diagnosed following subcutaneous injections of chloromethyl methyl ether in rats, 13 palpable lesions were present. Thus, these investigators observed papillomas, carcinomas. fibrosarcomas, and 1 fibroma in rats and mice I Presented in part at the Seventh Annual Meeting of the Society of Toxicology, Washington, received a high dose of 1500 mg/kg of urethan. from the controls. used alkylating agent in the chemical industry. n, D.C..
