The Council of Europe (1974) included it in the list of artificial flavouring sub- stances that may he added acmporarily to foodstuffs withouti hazard to public health.. CAS Registry Acute toxicitt. The acute oral LD, in rats was reported as 37 gkg (2-3-5-1 g/kg) and the acute dermal LDso in rabbits exceeded 5 gikg (Moreno. 1972). Work by Hercules, inc, (1962jishowed that the oral LDs0 for rats was 21 g/kg for z-pinene from steam distillation of wood and 3-2 gkg for thut from sulphate pulping. of wool, the signs. of acute intoxication being local irsitation. central nervous system depression and death from respitatory. failure. When. administered to shcep. x-pinene caused gross albuminuria and had a toxic action oni the liver and kidncys (Harvey. White Inhulution. The LCiso values (kthat concentrations for the shortest periodi causing death) for inhalation of saturated vapours (260 mgilitre) of x-pinene from stcam distillation of wood were. 625. 572 and 36H mglitremin in rats, guinea- pigs and mice, respectively, while for the saturated vapours (280 mglitre) of z-pinene from sulphute pulping, the LCIso values were 756, 896 and 420 mg litre, min, respectively (Hercules. Inc. 1962). The vapours produced local eye, nose and lung irritation and affected the central nervous system. The brain respiration of rats exposed to z-pinene vapour was not affected directly, but brai glucokinase and ATP levels as well as the activities of succinic delydrogenase and lactic dehydrogenase were lowered (Epshtein, 1959). Brain gluco- kinase activity returned to nornal 40-45 days alter exposure was terminated. In rats kept in an utmosphere saturated with z-pinene. glycogen: levels rose sharply. in the liver and less sharply in the muscles and remained normali in brain tissue. and the blood-sugan level remained normal Han taxicity. z-Pinene is absorhed through the skin, lungs and intestine, and benign skin tumours may result from chronic contact with it (Merck ludex. 19761. It may irritate the skin and mucous membranes and cause skin eruptiont, gastro-intestinal irritation.
