EFFECTS OF WEATHERING AND FLUE-CURING ON METHOMYL RESIDUES ON TOBACCO" R. B. LEIDY, J.J. DOMANSKI, P. L. HAIRE, and T. J. SHEETS North Carolina State University Releigh, Nort Carolina 27601. A replicated field experiment was conducted at two locations t0 determine the disappear- ance of methomyl from flue-cured tobacco. Inmediately after application, methomyl residues were 88 and 113 ppm ar Clayton and 44 and 105 ppm at Reidsville, respectively, for 0.56 and 1.12 kg/ha application rates. After 5 days these levels dropped to 0.7 and 2.8 ppm at Clayton and 1.4 and 4.1 ppm at Reidsville. At 9 days after application, 99% of the methomyl had disappeared at both locations. Losses of methomyl during flue-curing averaged 96% over lo- cations, rates of application, and times of harvest, comparedi to an average loss of 98% due to weathering in the field for 5 days. The disappearance of methomy! during the curing process Methomyl (S. metnylkv-tmethylcarpamoyljoxy thioacetimidate) has been used to con- trol tobacco insects since 1970, but few data on residue levels after application have been published. Tappan et al. (1973) reported that residuc levels of methomyl on flue-cured tobacco 5 days after applicationranged from 0.03 to 0.25 ppm. Surface applications ofan aqueous solution of "C-labeled methomy! to cotton leaves showed that 6.8, 1.8, and 0.0% of the residues remained at 24, 48, and 96 hr after treatment, respectively (Bull 1974). Metabolic studies with "C-labeled methomyl in tobacco (Harvey and Reiser 1973) and soil (Harvey and Pease 1973) showed that this compound rapidly degraded to CO, with the remainder of "C activity being incorporated into natural plant components and with traces of very polar compounds being formed in soil. Reeves and Woodham (1974) detected methomyl residues as low as 0.05 ppm in tobacco using a gas-liquid chromatog- raph equipped with a flame photometric detector in the sulfur mode. This study was conducted (a) to determine the effects of weathering and flue-curing on residue levels of methomy! on tobacco, (b) to ascertain if the preharvest interval could be reduced from the established 7 days, and (c) to verify the safety of the reentry period. Agricultural practices suggested by the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Sta- tion were employed from the time of seed bed preparation to the time of methomy! appli- "Paper No. 4645 of the Journal Series of the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station, Raleigh.
