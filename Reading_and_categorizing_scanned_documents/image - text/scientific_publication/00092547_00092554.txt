Journal of Labelled Compounds October-December Vol. V, No. 4 Isotopically-labeled natural products. I. Biosynthesis and isolation of 1-menthol-"C F. L. GAGER, Jr., M. T. CORE, R. T. BASS and R. W. JENKINS, Jr. Philip Morris Research Center, Richmond, Virginia. Received June 9, 1969. SUMMARY The biosynthesis by and the isolation of 1-menthol-HC from Mentha arvensis grown in 1CO2 are described. Crystals (18 mg; 3.2 mCijg) were obtained after column chromatographic purifica- tion of the steam distillate of the leaves. Purity of greater than 99.5 % was established by gas-liquid radiochromatography. INTRODUCTION. Menthol is used by the pharmaceutical, toiletry, and tobacco industries. However, labeled menthol has not become available commercially. Radioactive mint oils have been produced by several groups a, 2, 3) in biogenesis studies. Time-course experiments with 1CO, plus the incorporation of specific precursors have supported the biogenic scheme proposed by Reitsema (4). Only Mitsuhashi and co-workers (5) isolated labeled menthol and, by chemical degradations, showed the incorporation of carboxyl-labeled Two groups have produced radioactive material for tracer studies, but details have not been published. In one report, Stepka and Larson 16), described elaborate facilities and listed natural products isolated, but only mentioned growing mint. In the second report, Newell, Latimer, and Haefele (7) described the use of biosynthesized randomly-labeled menthol."C in cigarette smoke Our specific interest in tobacco products, in which menthol is a frequent additive, created a need for high specific activity labeled menthol. We therefore grew Mentha arvensis in 1CO, and isolated the 1-menthol."C. The facility coupled with appropriate isolation procedures, should be useful for the production of a broad spectrum of labeled natural products. acetate. experiments.
