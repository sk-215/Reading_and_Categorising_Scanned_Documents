Herscowitz Department of Microbiology, Georgetown University, Schools of Medicine and Rabbit alveolar macrophages (AM) were separated into four subpopulations by centrifugation on discontinuous density gradients ol Percoll. The subpopula- tions were compared to unseparated AM populations for their ability to provide accessory lunction to adherent cell-depleted splenocytes for antigen-stimu- siedymphoproliferation: and for the production oflymphokine. They were also tested for their abilty to modulate in vitro plaque-lorming (PFC) responses. AM subpopulations that provided accessory function for the production of migra. tion inhibitory factor (MiF)containing culture supernantants were recovered from the least dense fractions of the Percoll gradients. These celis were cytochemically characterized as mature cells. AM that suppressed the in vitro PFC response and augmented the antigen-stimulated vymphoproliferative re- sponse to the greatest degree were recovered from the most dense tractions ol the Percoll gradients and were characterized as immature cells. These results suggest that there are distinct subpepulatins of AM. tho function of which may represent different: stages of maturation (or differentiation).
