Box 17007, S-104 62 ENZELLb Stoekholm (Sweden) (Received March 10th, 1980) (Revision received' Aprili 10th, 1980) (Accepted April 12th, 1980) SUMMARY To clarify the mutagenic activity of individual smoke components, 239 compounds, representative of the gaseous and semivolatile phases of tobacco smoke, were assayed for mutagenicity towards 4 histidine-requiring mutants of Salmonella typhimurium (TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535 and TA 1537). All compounds were tested qualitatively both with and without metabolic activation using a liver fraction (S-9) from Aroclor 1254 or methylchol- anthrene induced rats. Without S-9, only 2,3-dimethylindole and 2,3,5- trimethylindole showed mutagenic activity that was not enhanced by the metabolic activation system. 2,6-Diaminotoluene and coronene, which like the above compounds are not documented carcinogens were found to be mutagenic for strain TA 98 with S-9. Mutagenic activity was also observed for the previously known mutagens benz(alpyrene, chrysene, benzla)- anthracene, perylene and B-naphthylamine, on exposure to strains TA 98 and/or TA 100 with S-9. INTRODUCTION Strong epidemiological evidence for A close correlation between tobacco smoking and lung cancer in man is available [11, as are animal experiments showing that t0u6o tar is carcinogenic (2). In view of the facts that such studies are laborious arid that there is good correlation between mutagenicity Address all correspondence to: Professor Lars Rutberg, Department of Bacteriology, Karolinska Institute, S-104 01 Stockholm, Sweden. 219
