MICROANALYSIS OF NICOTINE IN URINE AND PLASMA H. Mizunuma et al [EISEI KAGAKU 28 (1) 13-17 (1982)J Translation by Dr. Chin K. Lee INTRODUCTION As the relationship between tobacco and lung cancer becomes clearer, an increasing number of studies are carried out on the harmful effect of tobacco Numerous reports have been published on the effect of smoking on pregnant women the unborn child and smokers themselves, and the effect of passive smoking on non-smokers. Most of these studies are based on statistics and no direct evid- ence is available. In studying the effect of smoking on the living system, the microanalysis of nicotine, the major const tituent of tobacco smoke, in bio- logical sample is very important. Colorimetric and U.V. spectrophotometric methods are available for nicotine determination. However, these methods are inadequate for the micro- analysis of nicotine in body fluids (ng/ml). Langone et al (1) andi Matsukura et al (2)' have reported radioimmuno-a assay methods. Muranaka et al (3-6), Feyerabend et al (7, 8), Hengen (9), and Grubner et al (10) have developed gas chromatographic me thod using flame thermionic detector (FTD). Petrakis (11) has reported a microanalytical method based on mass fr agmentography. In spite of these methods, convenient, accurate and highly reproducible methods are being desired. In this report, we present a convenient method of extraction of nicotine from body fluids using the new absorbent, Extrelut, and a micro- analytical method by gas chromatography and mass fragmentography (MF). EXTRACTION OF NICOTINE WITH EXTRELUT The efficient extraction of minute quantity of nicotine from body fluid is not very simple. Solvent extraction extracts too many other interfering compounds and their separation presents problems In this work, we have tested the use of Extrelut in extraction. Extrelut is a diatomaceous packing material developed by Merck Co. The aqueous sample is introduced into the column and
