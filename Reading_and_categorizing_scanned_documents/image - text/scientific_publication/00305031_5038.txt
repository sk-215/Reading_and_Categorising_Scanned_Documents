EFFECTS OF WEATHERING AND FLUE-CURING ON METHOMYL RESIDUES ON TOBACCO' R. B. LEIDY,J.J. DOMANSKI, P. L. HAIRE, and T. J. SHEETS North Carolina Stave Uniersity Raleigh.. Norik Carolina 27607 A: replicated ficld experiment was conducted at two locations 10 determine the Jisappear. ance of mcthomyl Trom fluc-cured tobacco. Immediately alter application, methomyl residues were 88 and 113 ppm at Clayton and 44 and 105 ppm at Reidsville, respectively, for 0.56 and 1.12 kg/ha applicution rates. After: 5 days these levels dropped to 0.7 and 2.8 ppm at Clayton and 1.4 and 4.1 ppm at Reidsville. At 9 days after application, 99% of the methomy! had disappcared at both locations. Losses of methomy! during fuc-curing averaged 96% over lo. cations, rates of: application, and times of harvest, comparcd to an average loss of 98% duc to weathering in the field for 5 days. The disappearance of methomyi during the curing process Methomyl Gemebysemthysatsmaplosy thioacetimidate) has been used to con- trol tobacco insects since 1970, but few data on residue levels after application have been published. Tappan er al. (1973) reported that residue levels of methomy! on fuc-cured tobacco 5 days after application ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 ppm. Surface applications ofan aqueous solution of "C-labeled methomyl to cotton leaves showed that 6.8, 1.8, and 0.0% of the residues remained at 24, 48, and 96 hr after treatment, respectively (Bull 1974). Metabolic studies with "C-labeled methomyl in tobacco (Harvey. and Reiser 1973) and soil (Harvey and Pease 1973) showed that this compound rapidly degraded to CO, with the remainder of "C activity being incorporated into natural plant components and with traces of very polar compounds being formed in soil. Reeves und Woodhant (1974) detected methomyl residues as low as 0.05 ppm in tobacco using a gas-liquid chromatog- raph equipped with a flame photometric detector in the sulfur mode. This study was conducted (a) to determine the cftects of weathering and flue-curing on residue levels of methomyl on tobacco, (b) to ascertain if the preharvest inierval could be reduced from the established 7 days, and (c) to verify the salety of the reentry period. Agricultural practices suggested by the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Sta- tion were employed (rom the time of seed bed preparation to the time of methomylappli- 'Paper No, 4645 of the Journal Series uf the Nurth Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station, Raleigh, North was approximately the same for both lucations.
