By comparison of vapor composition of the Smoke from cellulose blended in the cigarettes with that of tobacco cigarettes alone, it is established that the major components of the vapor phase of the smoke were generated from the skeletal substances in tobacco leaf. Addition of glucose, fructose or sucrose to cigaretces exhibited increases of 2-methylfuran and 2,5-dimethylfuran in the vapor phase of the smoke. It was established that the furans above mentioned in the vapor phase of the smoke, which are characteristic in flue-cured tobacco smoke, were generated mainly from the sugars in tobacco leaf. 1. Introduction As a part of researches on the constituents of the vapor phase in tobacco Smoke, the analytical method for the vapor phase reported previously") was used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the vapor phase of smoke from various typcs of tobacco leaves. It was found that the major variations of the constituents in the tobacco specics were ac cetaldchyde, isoprene, acetonitrile, 2-nethyl furan, and 2,5-dimethyl furan. A distinctive characteristic of the smoke from Bright Yellow wa: S its considerably high concentration of 2-methyl furan and 2,5-dimethyl furan. 00383819 NATIONA.
