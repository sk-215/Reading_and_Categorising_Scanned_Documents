5/18 â‚¬ 50894 3 THE EFFECTS OF ACUTE TOBACCO SMOKE INHALATION ON THE PULMONARY HOST DEFENSES CLIN RES 26(3): 406A; 1978 SHEA, J/ HUBER, G MEETING ABSTRACT: "EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE LINKED CIGARETTE SMOKING WITH AN INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PULMONARY INFECTION, # IN ORDER TO HELP CLARIFY THIS ASSOCIATION, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF TOBACCO SMOKE EXPOSURE ON IN VIVO INTRAPULMONARY ANTIBACTERIAL DEFENSES IN RATS AND ON IN VITRO ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGE (AM) ANTIBACTERIAL FUNCTIONING, METHODS: INTRAPULMONARY BACTERIAL INACTIVATION WAS MEASURED IN RATS WHO RECEIVED AN AEROSOLIZED CHALLENGE OF RADIOLABELED STAPHYLOCOCCUS ALBUS AND WERE THEN EXPOSED TO TOBACCO SMOKE HOURLY FOR UP TO 6 HR. IN ADDITIONAL STUDIES, RATS NOT AEROSOLIZED WITH BACTERIA ALSO WERE EXPOSED TO SMOKE FOR 6 HR, AFTER WHICH AM WERE HARVESTED AND CULTURED WITH S. ALBUS FOR 1 HR. PHAGOCYTOSIS WAS EVALUATED AND THE INACTIVATION OF INTRACELLULAR BACTERIA QUANTITATED, RESULTS WERE COMPARED TO THOSE FROM APPROPRIATE CONTROLS, FINDINGS: INTRAPULMONARY BACTERIAL INACTIVATION WAS 51.4 AND 64,8% AFTER 3 AND 6 HR, RESPECTIVELY, OF IN VIVO TOBACCO SMOKE EXPOSURE, COMPARATIVE FIGURES IN CONTROLS WERE 86.8 AND 92.1%, IN VITRO BACTERIAL PHAGOCYTOSIS WAS SIMILAR IN AM FROM SMOKE-EXPOS RATS AND CONTROLS. AM FROM SMOKE-EXPOSED ANIMALS INACTIVATED ALL BUT 34.8, 21.9, AND 13.5% OF THE BACTERIA AT 1, 2, AND 3 HR AFTER THE INFECTION PERIOD. COMPARATIVE VALUES FOR CONTROL AM WERE 48.7, 22.6, AND 10.1%.
